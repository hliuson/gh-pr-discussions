# Dataset Analysis Report

## 1. Discussion Quality
- Average comment length: ~147 characters.
- Minimum comment length: 55, maximum: 349.
- Many comments are short maintenance notes (“removed it now”), which don’t provide much depth.
- Some longer comments exist (e.g., 219 characters), but overall quality is mixed.

## 2. Summarization Quality
- The dataset currently does not include summaries.
- This is a limitation: we cannot yet assess summarization quality.
- Next step: integrate summarization module into the pipeline.

## 3. Code Diff Length
- Avg additions: 0.5, Avg deletions: 3.8, Avg changed files: 1.
- ⚠️ 6 PRs had fewer than 10 total changes.
- ⚠️ 0 PRs had more than 1000 changes.
- The dataset is dominated by **small PRs**, which limits discussion depth and summarization opportunities.

## Summary & Next Steps
- The dataset shows a tendency toward short discussions and small PRs.
- Action items:
  - Add filtering for trivial comments (<50 characters).
  - Broaden PR selection to include larger PRs (>1000 changes).
  - Incorporate summarization module to evaluate summary quality.
