    "unsumarized_comments": "The PR fails to meet some basic requirements but shows a good effort. Issues:\n1. The PR template is not properly filled out - missing test plan and checklist items\n2. While the scope is clear (frontend) and shown in the title correctly, documentation of changes could be clearer\n3. No clear explanation in PR body about 'why' these changes were needed\n4. No test plan or testing notes provided for such a large UI change\n\nHowever, the code itself looks well-structured with clear component organization and documentation. The TODO comments also show good forward planning.\n## Feedback for PR Improvement\n\n### Missing PR Template & Checklist\nPlease fill out the complete PR template, including the checklist section. This is required for all PRs and helps reviewers understand what's being changed and how it's been tested.\n\n### Scope Mismatch\nYour PR title mentions only frontend changes (`feat(frontend)`), but the diff shows significant backend additions including:\n- New API routes in `/api/builder/`\n- New DB functions and models\n- Changes to store routes\n\nPlease update your title to reflect both frontend and backend changes, or better explain in the description why backend changes were needed for this frontend redesign.\n\n### User ID Validation\nSome of the new backend functions in `backend/server/v2/builder/db.py` don't appear to validate user permissions via user_id. Please review these functions to ensure proper authorization is in place or provide an explanation for why user_id checks aren't needed.\n\n### Merge Conflicts\nThis PR has merge conflicts that need to be resolved before it can be merged.\n\n### Testing\nPlease include information about how you've tested these changes, particularly since they span both frontend and backend components.\n\nOnce you've addressed these issues, the PR should be ready for re-review.\nThank you for your work on redesigning the block menu.

I've identified a few issues that need to be addressed before this can be merged:\n\n1. **Scope mismatch**: While your PR title indicates this is a frontend change, approximately half of the changes are backend-related (new API endpoints, models, database functions). The PR title and description should accurately reflect all major components being changed.\n\n2. **Missing checklist**: For substantial code changes like this, the PR template checklist needs to be completed to ensure proper testing and quality checks. Please add the checklist and check off the appropriate items.\n\n3. **Backend changes documentation**: The PR description doesn't mention any of the backend changes. Please update the description to include details about the new backend/server/v2/builder files and endpoints you're adding.\n\nAdditionally, I notice you've marked some items with \"BLOCK MENU TODO:\" for future work. If these are part of this redesign effort but will be addressed in separate PRs, that's fine, but please make that clear in the description.\n\nOnce you've updated the PR title to accurately reflect both frontend and backend changes, completed the required checklist, and expanded the description to cover all major components being changed, we can proceed with the review process.\nThanks for your PR on redesigning the block menu. I noticed a few things that need to be addressed before this can be merged:\n\n1. **Missing Checklist**: Please include the complete PR checklist in your description. Since your changes include significant code modifications, you'll need to add the checklist with appropriate test plans.\n\n2. **Scope Mismatch**: Your PR title only mentions frontend changes (`feat(frontend)`), but the diff shows substantial backend additions including:\n   - New API routes in `/api/builder`\n   - New database functionality\n   - New models and response types\n\n   Please update your PR title to reflect both the frontend and backend changes, perhaps something like `feat(frontend,backend): Redesign block menu on builder page`.\n\n3. **PR Description**: Consider enhancing your description to explain more about the purpose of the backend changes and how they relate to the frontend block menu redesign.\n\nThe changes themselves look promising, but we need to ensure the PR follows our submission guidelines before proceeding with the review of the actual implementation. Please make these updates so we can move forward with the review.\nThank you for your work on redesigning the block menu! I have a few concerns that need to be addressed before this PR can be merged:\n\n1. **Missing Checklist**: The PR description is missing the required checklist. Please update your description to include the standard checklist and fill it out completely.\n\n2. **Scope Mismatch**: The PR title mentions only frontend changes (`feat(frontend)`), but the diff shows significant backend changes as well. Please update the PR title to accurately reflect the scope of your changes. Something like `feat(platform): Redesign block menu on builder page` or `feat(platform/frontend,platform/backend): Redesign block menu on builder page` would be more appropriate.\n\n3. **Backend Changes**: The PR includes substantial backend additions:\n   - New builder routes and endpoints\n   - New database functions and models\n   - Changes to the store API\n\nPlease make sure to include these backend changes in your test plan when you add the checklist.\n\nOnce these items are addressed, we can proceed with the review of the code itself.

If that env var is set then the UI should display a clear warning and list the plugins that are registered.\n@BillSchumacher does this seem like a reasonable API to land on? \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39720479/232123556-ef3f7622-7794-4246-b782-0d3b5f3df9b4.png)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nPromptName = str\r\nPromptRole = str\r\nPromptGoals = List[str]\r\nPrompt = tuple[PromptName, PromptRole, PromptGoals]\r\n\r\npost_prompt(prompt: Prompt) -> Prompt\r\n\r\non_planning(prompt: Prompt, messages: List[str]) -> Optional[str]\r\npost_planning(response: str) -> str\r\n\r\npre_instruction(messages: List[str]) -> List[str]\r\non_instruction(messages: List[str]) -> Optional[str]\r\n# TODO: Better JSON type\r\npost_instruction(response: str) -> str\r\n\r\npre_command(instruction: str) -> str\r\npost_command(messages: List[str]) -> List[str]\r\n```\nAs an example for this kind of architecture, the guy on discord who swapped out JSON instructions with YAML could override `pre_instruction` to ask for YAML instead of JSON, then override `pre_command` to convert the YAML back to json so that existing commands still work unchanged\n> @BillSchumacher does this seem like a reasonable API to land on? ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39720479/232123556-ef3f7622-7794-4246-b782-0d3b5f3df9b4.png)\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> PromptName = str\r\n> PromptRole = str\r\n> PromptGoals = List[str]\r\n> Prompt = tuple[PromptName, PromptRole, PromptGoals]\r\n> \r\n> post_prompt(prompt: Prompt) -> Prompt\r\n> \r\n> on_planning(prompt: Prompt, messages: List[str]) -> Optional[str]\r\n> post_planning(response: str) -> str\r\n> \r\n> pre_instruction(messages: List[str]) -> List[str]\r\n> on_instruction(messages: List[str]) -> Optional[str]\r\n> # TODO: Better JSON type\r\n> post_instruction(response: str) -> str\r\n> \r\n> pre_command(instruction: str) -> str\r\n> post_command(messages: List[str]) -> List[str]\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nYeah I like it =)\nImplementation note, even though we are passing a PromptGenerator object to the on_planning method of the plugin changing it's values will not change the prompt.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR raises several critical technical concerns and implementation suggestions regarding the plug-in integration within the Auto-GPT framework. Firstly, the plugin whitelist validation, which currently checks only by name, presents a potential security risk for abuse; it's recommended to enhance this by verifying against already-loaded plugins of the same name. Furthermore, introducing a method for users to add plugins directly through `requirements.txt` is suggested, specifically by using a commit reference URL format. \n\nTo strengthen plugin security, each plugin should require manual authorization at startup unless a specific environment variable (`SKIP_PLUGIN_AUTH=true`) is set. In terms of API design, the proposed architecture for hooks (e.g., `post_prompt`, `on_planning`) seems reasonable, but careful attention is needed to ensure alterations to `PromptGenerator` do not unintentionally affect existing prompts. Finally, when modifying context, there should be careful tracking of token costs to prevent exceeding limits during processing."

Really awesome job!\r\n\r\nFor the ones struggling to implement this, it took me a while finding the right model for the job.

While I have a decent processor and 32G of ram (and a geforce RTX 3070ti) and am running the model from a fast SSD, it will not utilize my full machine. It will actually timeout (600 seconds) every request unless I put the TIMEOUT_SECS = 6000 in the api_requestor.py file of autoGPT. The 7B models were a bit faster, but weren't able to respond in the way that allows autoGPT to actually work. I'm thinking of trying to get it to work with my videocard, since it is the most high end part of my pc, but am not quite sure yet where to start. Will let you know if I make it :) \n> Thanks both! I'm indeed using keldenl's gpt-llama.cpp currently, but will try your suggestion! I hope I can just direct the OPENAI_API_BASE_URL to the llama-cpp-python[server]. (PS: today autoGPT actually reached my 6000 second request timeout as well, so need to find a better solution xD)\r\n\r\ndon't get confused, keldenl's project uses the standard llama.cpp binary, wich is written in cpp. llama-cpp-python is a different proect (python bindings for llama.cpp)\r\n\r\nI suggest you to run llama.ccp alone to verify it's compiled correctly and it's actually using the cpu. if it's using cuBLAS, you should see \"blas=1\" after it loaded the model.\r\nIf you are using the same projects you were using the first time, you most likely need to run \"make clean\" before building it with cuBLAS support.\n> This PR conflicts with #3222 and is not atomic. Please fix that so we can review it.\r\n\r\nWhy are you saying that? the hardcoded embedding dimension using in memory-related classes and those settings wich he's adding are different things. there are no conflicts.\r\nWe also modified different files, only .env.template  and config.py are in common\nMy last attempt on fixing the milvus_memory_test.py test didn't really had the desired result and CodeCov still marks it as uncovered (the test itself still runs fine). But i'm sure it actually is covered, that code is in the __init__ method and the class is initilized in both milvus_memory_tests.py files.\r\nI guess it's because of that MockConfig object in tests/milvus_memory_test.py\r\nIsn't it better to just initialize a new Config() class like the test under the integration folder already does?\r\n\r\n\r\n\n> This is a mass message from the AutoGPT core team.

CC @Significant-Gravitas, @Torantulino, @p-i-, @Pwuts \r\n  \r\nLots of work has gone into it, it's working great in a fork, and it is a very significant upgrade to the base Auto-GPT; providing functionality which is important to the \"core\" of Auto-GPT going forward.\n> I don't think you quite understand why they aren't merging. The reason for it is the re-arch is going to invalidate all current PRs, because it is going to introduce massive breaking changes to how AutoGPT works. Also not a good idea to beg for merge IMO.\r\n\r\nWell, in the wiki it's also written that it can be a good idea to merge before the re-integration\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/wiki/Architecting#2-push-for-your-pr-to-be-merged-into-master-before-re-integration\r\n\r\nBut i understand that there are many changes wich are way more complex and critical than mine, and i'm perfectly ok to wait and eventually rewrite something if the mantainers require that.\r\n\r\nAlso... @ntindle asked for a test to coverage the new code.\r\nI don't really know what can be a good way to make an unit test for this, since this is meant to connect to any external openai-compliant API.\r\nIt still uses all the core functions used for interacting with GPT3.5 and GPT4, is it really needed/useful?\n> Also not a good idea to beg for merge IMO.\r\n\r\nI understand it's strange.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR has several technical concerns noted. First, the performance issues with the `ggml-vicuna-13b-1.1-q4_2.bin` model highlight a significant slowdown on described hardware, suggesting that CPU utilization may be suboptimal. The proposal to adjust the `TIMEOUT_SECS` in `api_requestor.py` raises questions about the API's responsiveness under load. There are architectural suggestions to isolate the `llama.cpp` build process to ensure it runs with cuBLAS support by checking for \"blas=1.\" The mention of `make clean` before building is critical for avoiding build artifacts. Additionally, the conflicting PR (#3222) needs resolution, as it isn't atomic. Regarding test coverage in `milvus_memory_test.py`, replacing the mocked configuration with a direct instantiation of the `Config()` class may improve test accuracy. Lastly, there are concerns regarding merging amidst significant architectural changes, emphasizing the importance of addressing dependencies before proceeding."

However, the overall changes are well documented and the PR appears focused on store submission functionality with clear explanations of the changes made. The DB changes look like they properly handle user_id access through proper relations.\nThe PR looks solid and follows most rules, but has a few minor issues: 1) The PR title has a scope but it's not properly formatted with parentheses - should be feat(backend): instead of feat:. 2) The checklist is not completely filled out (boxes are unchecked). However, they have included a clear test plan reference which somewhat mitigates this. The changes themselves look well documented and structured, with appropriate migrations and schema updates. The changes also appear to be within scope based on the stated purpose.\nThe PR generally follows the requirements but has some issues: 1) The title follows conventional commit format correctly with feat(backend). 2) Changes are clearly documented. 3) The PR template is filled out, though not all checkboxes are checked. 4) Regarding data/*.py changes rule - this PR doesn't touch those files so that rule isn't applicable. 5) No new frontend routes added so middleware rule isn't applicable. However, the PR is marked as failing because the test plan section indicates they will 'Use the store codepaths from the release testplan doc' but haven't actually executed those tests yet (box unchecked). The tests should be completed before merging.\nThe PR has several issues that need to be addressed:\n1. The test plan shows as unchecked and references an external document without specifying the actual tests\n2. The PR contains database migrations but there is no clear testing evidence for data preservation\n3. The changes appear significant enough to warrant more detailed testing documentation\n\nHowever, the PR has positive aspects:\n1. Clear description of changes with rationale\n2. Well-organized changes with proper scoping\n3. Migration file is included for database changes\n4. The changes appear to be focused on a single feature area (store submissions)\nThe PR has several issues that need to be addressed but generally follows good practices:\n\n1. The PR title and scope are clear and follow conventional commit format\n2. Changes are well documented and explained\n3. The code changes primarily involve data/*.py files and properly handle user_id checks\n4. There is a test plan referenced though not executed yet\n\nMain concerns:\n- Test plan is referenced but not completed/executed yet\n- Some checkboxes in template are not filled out (though this is noted as being lenient about)\n- The scope of changes is quite large but seems to be a cohesive set of related changes\n\nGiven that we're being lenient about the template and the changes are well documented with appropriate user_id handling, this warrants a 'failure' rather than error, primarily due to incomplete testing.\nThis PR has several potential issues:\n1. The test plan is not executed according to the checklist item\n2. The test plan references an external doc without specifics in PR\n3. Lacks data/*.py analysis specifically for user_id handling which is required in our checks\n4. However, looking at the changes, this is a well structured database migration with proper type safety and security considerations built in. The code changes appear thorough and properly tested based on the test files included, even if execution isn't marked.\nThis PR follows most guidelines but has a few minor issues: 1) The scope in the title 'backend' matches the changes, 2) The checklist is properly filled out with relevant tests explained, 3) The PR description clearly explains the changes and motivation. However, there are changes to data/*.py files that handle user_id (graph.py) but there's no explicit explanation about how the user_id comparison is handled safely. The changes appear to be improving the security check but this should be documented.\nThis PR has several issues that need addressing according to the rules:\n1. The PR title has the correct scope format 'feat(backend)'\n2. The changes in data/graph.py involve user_id checks and appear to be handled correctly with appropriate comparisons\n3. The PR template is incompletely filled out - it's marked as using the 'store codepaths from release testplan' but doesn't detail what those are, making it difficult to verify the testing was thorough\n4. The changes seem to be all in scope relating to store listing submissions functionality\n5. The configuration section of the template hasn't been removed despite not being needed for these changes\nWhile the PR demonstrates good practices in several areas including detailed changes and testing coverage, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The PR doesn't verify specifically that data/*.py changes handle user_id correctly, especially in critical data access functions\n2. The PR scope prefix is present and correctly formatted as 'feat(backend)'\n3. The PR's description and changes are well documented and appear complete\n4. The PR has a filled checklist with testing details from the release testplan doc\n\nOverall the PR is close but needs verification of user_id handling in data/*.py changes.\nThe PR follows most rules but has a few issues:\n1. While it has a scope in the title (backend), the PR description is missing crucial details about user_id handling in the data/*.py changes\n2. The PR involves multiple data/*.py files (graph.py and notifications.py) which could potentially have security implications around user_id access\n3. While the test plan references an external doc, it doesn't explicitly verify the user_id handling changes\n4. The testing checklist isn't properly filled out - it only has a reference without the specific test steps broken down\n\nHowever, the PR has:\n- Clear scope in title\n- Comprehensive documentation of changes\n- Template sections appropriately used/removed\n- Changes appear focused on the intended scope\nThis PR meets most requirements but has a few issues:\n1. The PR title has a scope 'backend' which is good\n2. The description explains the changes clearly and provides good detail\n3. The PR template is properly filled out including testing\n4. The data files with changes (graph.py and notifications.py) do maintain user_id checks appropriately\n5. No new frontend base routes added that would need middleware protection\n\nHowever:\n- The test plan references a private document which makes it impossible to verify the test coverage properly. While the author indicates it's fine, this should be documented directly in the PR.\n- Some sections of the template checklist are not fully marked (configuration section is present but unchecked despite having db changes)\nThis PR appears well structured and follows most guidelines, but has some issues:\n1. The PR scope in title (backend) is correct\n2. The changes are well documented\n3. The checklist is partially completed with a referenced test plan\n4. The changes include proper handling of user_id in data/*.py files\n5. However, there is an issue with the test plan - it references a private document that can't be verified, which goes against transparency best practices\n6. Additionally, the checklist skips the configuration section entirely rather than marking it as not applicable",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment identifies several specific issues and recommendations regarding the submission. Key concerns include:\n\n1. **PR Template**: The template is inadequately filled out, with checklist items listed but not checked. Proper documentation of changes, a detailed test plan, and verification steps are necessary, especially for significant database migrations.\n\n2. **Test Plan**: The referenced test plan is not executed or detailed within the PR, creating challenges in verifying the completeness of testing efforts. The author should include specific tests in the PR instead of relying on external documentation.\n\n3. **User ID Handling**: The changes in `data/*.py`, particularly in `graph.py`, regard user_id checks, but there's insufficient explanation on how these are safely managed.\n\n4. **PR Title**: While the title adheres to conventional commit guidelines with a scope of `feat(backend)`, it should be clarified further.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Although changes are generally well documented and appear aligned with the intended scope, the lack of an explicit test framework compromises confidence in the implemented changes.\n\nThe PR would benefit from enhancing transparency in the testing process and providing explicit security considerations around user_id access."

finding `mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2`. Fix the latter -> fix the former. Although maybe we should have a more descriptive error message instead of that huge stack trace.\r\n\r\n> Also this should try mattching better. For example just `mistral` should work if its the only one or `mistral-7b` if there's two. Adding parts should only be required rarely\r\n\r\nI disagree. A value should have the same meaning, regardless of circumstances. Setting `mistral` may suddenly break if a second mistral model is installed. That's undesirable behavior in my opinion.\nWhile you're at it, could you check why Autogpt sends empty assisstant conntents when using local llm settings?\r\nI used lmstudio as the openai base url and get errors because autogpt keeps sending this after a failed response:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"system\",\r\n      \"content\": \"ERROR PARSING YOUR RESPONSE:\\n\\nValidationError: 3 validation errors for OneShotAgentActionProposal\\nthoughts -> plan\\n  field required (type=value_error.missing)\\nthoughts -> speak\\n  field required (type=value_error.missing)\\nuse_tool\\n  field required (type=value_error.missing)\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"content\": \"\",\r\n      \"role\": \"assistant\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"role\": \"system\",\r\n      \"content\": \"ERROR PARSING YOUR RESPONSE:\\n\\nInvalidAgentResponseError: Assistant response has no text content\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\r\n}\r\n[2024-06-16 17:28:16.570] [ERROR] [Server Error] {\"title\":\"'messages' array must only contain objects with a 'content' field that is not empty\"}\r\n```\nI think we shouldn't automatically match the name (or at least not without any warning); this may lead to unexpected behaviour. We can make error message better and include `did you mean \"mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2\"?`, as a hint for user.\nI am currently experiencing these issues: https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/issues/356, https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/issues/100.\r\n\r\nMay need to amend `llamafile/serve.py` further to fix this for WSL.\r\n\r\n**Update:** this isn't scriptable and not our problem. I'll amend the docs with a note that llamafiles can't be run from WSL, but can still be used by running them on Windows and then connecting to them in WSL.",
    "sumarized_length": 1109,
    "summarized_comments": "This PR introduces significant changes, including new LLM provider integrations and modifications affecting core configuration logic. The following issues were raised:\n\n1. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: The `check_model_llamafile` method in `configurator.py` risks exposing sensitive API credentials in error messages. It’s recommended to remove or mask these details to mitigate security risks.\n\n2. **Hardcoded Values**: The `seed` in the `LlamafileProvider`'s `_create_chat_completion` method is hard-coded, limiting the model's response variability. It should either be removed or made configurable.\n\n3. **Error Handling Improvements**: The reported stack trace suggests a need for better error messages. Instead of generic errors, providing hints about potential configuration issues (e.g., suggesting correct model names) would enhance user experience.\n\nLastly, concerns were raised regarding the behavior of auto-matching model names, which could lead to unexpected failures. It’s crucial to ensure that functionality remains consistent across different setups, especially when using local configurations."

If the script is not able to access the file, the most likely reason is that the working directory of the script execution is not set correctly.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, you can modify the load_prompt function to use an absolute path instead of a relative path.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment highlights several critical implementation issues and suggestions:\n\n1. **Dependency Management**: The use of `playsound` requires `PyObjC` for efficiency, which should be documented as a prerequisite. Additionally, `pyyaml` was added to `requirements.txt`, yet an import error for `yaml` was initially encountered, indicating potential oversights in dependency handling.\n\n2. **Attribute Error**: The `Config` object lacks the `smart_llm_model` attribute, necessitating a review of the configuration structure to ensure all attributes are properly defined and documented.\n\n3. **File Access**: The `load_prompt` function should be modified to use absolute paths formed with the `os` module to avoid relative path issues that arise from incorrect script execution contexts.\n\n4. **Token Limitations**: A critical error indicates the need to manage message lengths effectively; setting the context length in `config.py` to a maximum of 2000 tokens is advised, particularly for the gpt-3 model, which has a limit of 4096 tokens.\n\n5. **Environment Variables**: It is suggested to use environment variables for configurations, reducing hardcoded values and enabling easier adjustments in different environments.\n\nOverall, these points require immediate attention to enhance code reliability and maintainability."

While the changes are cohesive and related to the stated purpose, larger PRs are inherently riskier. Consider breaking future changes into smaller, more focused PRs if possible.\n\n#### Additional considerations:\n\n- The changes to `useAgentGraph` significantly improve the architecture, making the code more maintainable. Nice work on this refactoring.\n- The move from fire-and-forget methods to direct action callbacks is a good pattern improvement.\n- The rework of UI components for credentials input and run management looks much cleaner and more consistent.\n\nPlease complete the testing according to your test plan and update the PR by checking off those items in the checklist. Once the testing is complete, this PR should be ready for approval.\nThis PR looks good overall! The implementation for Builder credentials support and UX improvements is well-structured, and the test plan is thorough.\n\nThere's just one small issue to fix before this can be merged:\n\n- The parent checkbox for \"I have tested my changes according to the test plan\" should be checked since all the sub-items are checked. Please update this in the PR description.\n\nSome observations about your implementation:\n\n1. Great work on the refactoring to use `GraphMeta` and improve type safety throughout the codebase.\n\n2. The UX improvements for moving around the canvas look excellent - reducing unnecessary re-renders should make the builder experience much smoother.\n\n3. Good refactoring of the run input UI components to leverage the existing `AgentRunDraftView` - this creates consistency between the Builder and Library experiences.\n\n4. The move of the webhook setup endpoint to `/library/presets/setup-trigger` makes sense from an API organization perspective.\n\nOnce you check that parent checkbox in the PR description, this should be ready to merge!",

I don't know if that will happen soon, so in the meantime I've pushed the changes to [this](https://github.com/thenbe/thefuck/tree/nix-shell-new) new branch instead, which [builds](https://github.com/thenbe/thefuck/compare/nix-shell...thenbe:thefuck:nix-shell-new) on this here PR. You can use the updated rule by adding it as a [custom rule](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-your-own-rules) to your config.\r\n\r\nIn the new rule, three variants are suggested. Assuming I run `cowsay hello world`, I am presented with the following:\r\n\r\n1. `nix run nixpkgs#cowsay -- hello world`: This runs my command in a non-interactive shell. Uses the nix unified CLI.\r\n1. `nix shell nixpkgs#cowsay`: This enters an interactive shell with `cowsay` available, but does not run any command. This is useful if you'd rather run the command yourself after entering the shell because your command requires delicate massaging (e.g. running it with `sudo`, prefixing it with environment variable, juggling quote variants, etc).\r\n1. `nix-shell -p cowsay --run \"cowsay hello world\"`. This runs my command in a non-interactive shell. Uses the nix original CLI.\r\n1. `nix shell nixpkgs#cowsay --command cowsay hello world`: Very similar to the first one so I've personally disabled this one.\r\n\r\n### Thoughts on future updates:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- It'd be nice if there was a variant that runs my command and then _keeps me_ in the shell.\r\n  - For the original CLI, we [can](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.19/command-ref/nix-shell#options) add a `--command \"echo hello; return\"` to our `nix-shell` invocation.\r\n  - For the unified CLI: not sure yet, we might need to do something like this example from the [docs](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.19/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-shell): ` nix shell nixpkgs#gnumake --command sh -c \"cd src && make\"`\r\n- We should expose a couple of flags for users to configure this.\r\n  - `disable_unified_cli` (boolean)\r\n  - `disable_original_cli` (boolean)\r\n- As far as I can tell, the `command-not-found` db doesn't really play nice if you use flakes to configure your system and might return stale results (unless you update it manually?). [`nix-index`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-index) seems to be the go-to alternative. It'd be great if we could optionally use that instead (perhaps behind a flag `enable_nix_index` for users who have installed `nix-index` (`programs.nix-index.enable = true;` in home manager).\n@thenbe i agree integrating with `nix-index`'s `command-not-found` replacement seems cool, as a flake user.\r\ni kinda wish we could have `command-not-found` (and this `thefuck` integration) [extend to flake inputs beyond nixpkgs](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-index/issues/244) as well, such as to packages from NUR for example. preferably this should be dynamic based on your inputs rather than hardcoded to specific ones like nixpkgs, or NUR for that matter.\r\ni'll admit i haven't really figured out how that might work tho.\njust tried these with a command like `program_i_have | program_i_dont_have`, seems that may complicate the suggestions a bit\n@thenbe hm, i'm not sure.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfortune | cowsay\r\nThe program 'cowsay' is not in your PATH. It is provided by several packages.\r\nYou can make it available in an ephemeral shell by typing one of the following:\r\n  nix-shell -p cowsay\r\n  nix-shell -p neo-cowsay\r\n$ fuck\r\nnix run nixpkgs#fortune | cowsay\r\n```\r\n\r\nfeels like it knows about the whole command given it's reproducing it?\r\n\nanother common nix thing we might be able to address from `thefuck` would be errors about packages being unfree\r\n\r\nedit: https://github.com/KiaraGrouwstra/thefuck/commit/16d838bf6f63117b161a2f1e6572e06108b007eb\r\n\nIf I'm only looking to execute a program (and don't need to be dropped into a shell) then I prefer `nix run` over `nix shell` as the [documentation](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.19/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-run) suggests `nix run` specifically for this use case.\r\n\r\nI also recall `nix run` being more performant (perhaps because we forego the overhead of launching a shell?). This last point is not derived from benchmarks, only anecdotal evidence.\r\n\r\n> i guess the latter seems a bit more generic in case of handling non-standard binaries at least\r\n\r\nI've added this variant (the 4th one in my [previous post](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/pull/1393#issuecomment-1961487094)), but disabled it after a while when I realized that I never reach for it. Do you find that you still need it over `nix run` (the 1st variant in my previous post)?\n> another common nix thing we might be able to address from `thefuck` would be errors about packages being unfree\r\n> \r\n> edit: [KiaraGrouwstra@16d838b](https://github.com/KiaraGrouwstra/thefuck/commit/16d838bf6f63117b161a2f1e6572e06108b007eb)\r\n\r\nThis would be useful. Does it still complain about the `--impure` flag? Or do you use a workaround for that?\nI just have it aliased to `f` for extra convenience.\r\n\r\nI opted not to package it for nix separately since `fuck` already exposes a method for easily adding custom rules.

    "summarized_comments": "In the PR, it's noted that using an overlay to implement the changes is feasible, although issues arise without setting `doCheck = false;`, leading to a failed build due to a missing module (`pytest_docker_pexpect`) and a deprecation warning regarding `distutils`. Suggestions to enhance integration include utilizing `nix run` for executing commands and enabling a more dynamic selection of packages beyond just `nixpkgs`, potentially addressing errors related to unfree packages. \n\nFuture updates should consider exposing configuration flags (`disable_unified_cli`, `disable_original_cli`) and allowing optional use of `nix-index` for better command-not-found handling. The unified CLI requires `--impure` to bypass environment variable constraints, prompting the need for documentation on this limitation. There's interest in a variant that retains users in a shell post-command execution and potential solutions for handling pipeline commands. Overall, actionable next steps involve refining error handling and addressing package evaluation issues."

    "unsumarized_comments": "> This even supports sync and async yield dependencies, so that you can easily do startup/shutdown handling\r\n\r\nImplementing this requires:\r\n1. Creating an `AsyncContextStack` that the app lifetime scoped dependencies can use.\r\n2. Binding that `AsyncContextStack` to app startup/shutdown.\r\n\r\n(1) is pretty straightforward.\r\n(2) is a bit trickier, mainly because Starlette now supports:\r\n- `app.on_event(\"startup\")(...)`\r\n- `Starlette(on_startup=[....])`\r\n- `Starlette(lifespan=...)`\r\n\r\nAnd if you set _any_ `on_startup` events, using `Starlette(lifespan=...)` will raise an error.\r\nSo you have to choose one or the other.\r\nFastAPI currently does not support `Starlette(lifespan=...)`, so I guess we can use `on_startup/on_shutdown`, but _if_ FastAPI ever does want to support `Starlette(lifespan=...)`, that would require modifying this implementation.\nFirstly, thank you for the extensive and detailed feedback!\r\n\r\n> we might just have different use cases for these\r\n\r\nThis is very possible, I may have been shortsighted with my use cases, but I'll try to answer some of good questions you bring up\r\n\r\n> It's also unclear to me what happens if the same function ends up called both as a request-scoped and a lifetime-scoped dependency at different places throughout the application\r\n\r\n> Would the request-scoped dep short-circuit to using the already available lifetime dep or would it create a separate instance of it?\r\n\r\nI think this is an important question. To me it boils down to \"is an app lifespan dep == to the same dep but with a request lifespan?\". Let me know if this interpretation is incorrect.\r\nWe can make it work either way, I think we'd just have to add a tuple element to the cache key to make them unequal.\r\nIn other words, we can have either of these two work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Config:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n\r\ndef get_config() -> Config:\r\n    return Config()\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.get(\"/\")\r\ndef root(cfg1 = Depends(get_config, lifetime=\"app\"), cfg2 = Depends(get_config)):\r\n    # note that this would only apply to the first call\r\n    # subsequent calls would depend on the resolution of the below discussion regarding cache keys\r\n    assert cfg1 is cfg2  # option 1, current implementation\r\n    assert cfg1 is not cfg2  # option 2, adding the `lifetime` parameter as a cache key element\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we add the `lifetime` value to the cache key ([here](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/e721d0435080ad339188bb8519c53c07e59ed859/fastapi/dependencies/models.py#L58)), we should get option 2. Otherwise we get option 1.\r\n\r\n> On one hand, it means any dependency marked as a lifetime dep anywhere causes all of its transitive dependencies to be run and cached as lifetime deps at the same time, which may not be what the user intended\r\n\r\nThe intention is that only the top level (let's call it root) dependency gets marked as a lifetime dependency and cached as such. If a transitive dependency (`get_config` in this example) is used by both a lifetime dependency and a non-lifetime dependency it will only be \"shared\" the first call:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Config:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n\r\ndef get_config() -> Config:\r\n    return Config()\r\n\r\n\r\ndef lifetime_dep(cfg: Config = Depends(get_config)):\r\n    return cfg\r\n\r\ndef request_dep(cfg: Config = Depends(get_config)):\r\n   return cfg\r\n\r\ncalls = 0\r\n\r\n@app.get(\"/\")\r\ndef root(cfg1 = Depends(lifetime_dep, lifetime=\"app\"), cfg2 = Depends(request_dep)):\r\n    global calls\r\n    calls +=1\r\n    if calls == 1:\r\n        assert cfg1 is cfg2\r\n    else:\r\n        assert cfg1 is not cfg2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, `get_config` is used as a request lifetime sub dependency from both `lifetime_dep ` and `request_dep`.\r\nSo it should definitely be the same for both.\r\nThus in the first call, `cfg1` is the same as `cfg2`.\r\nBut in subsequent calls, `cfg1` is always the same object, since it is coming from `lifetime_dep` which is cached.\r\n`cfg2` is regenerated on every call.\r\n\r\n>  I'm not sure of the benefit of lazily-loaded shared resources compared to having dependencies context-managed by the lifetime protocol \r\n\r\nI agree, it would be nice to have the opposite (DI for the startup/shutdown system) as well. Like you say, it often makes sense to not even start the application unless the database, etc. are able to connect. But maybe there is a use case for both?\r\n\r\n> just a plain reverse proxy for a small API server\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, even simple reverse proxies like NGINX have healthcheck functionality.\r\n\r\nIn your use case, how do you know a deploy was successful if you don't have some sort of healthcheck / rediness?\r\n\r\n> I'm not personally sold on having the dependency's lifespan be specified on the caller's end instead of the dependency's end\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a solution, but maybe something like the following can be used to clean up things:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# in db.py or something\r\ndef get_db_connection(cfg: Config = Depends(get_config)) -> Connection:\r\n    # do some stuff with cfg to get a database connection\r\n\r\ndef DBConnection() -> Connection:\r\n    return Depends(get_db_connection, lifetime=\"app\")\r\n\r\n# in main.py\r\n@app.get(\"/\")\r\ndef root(conn: Connection = DBConnection()):\r\n    ...\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow the caller doesn't have to specify `Depends(..., lifetime=\"app\")`.\r\nThis does make overrides a bit uglier though because you have to know to override `get_db_connection` and not `DBConnection`.\r\nPerhaps there are cleaner alternatives involving a hashable class implementing `__call__`.\n> I'm not personally sold on having the dependency's lifespan be specified on the caller's end instead of the dependency's end. \r\n\r\n+1 on this, not a big fan as well.\r\n\r\n> Now the caller doesn't have to specify Depends(..., lifetime=\"app\").\r\n\r\nIn that case, if dependency behavior should be defined by the user I would prefer having a factory function handling this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef AppDepends(*args, **kwargs) -> Any:\r\n    return Depends(*args, **kwargs, lifespan=\"app\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich then can be use like a traditional one:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.get(\"/\")\r\ndef root(cfg1 = AppDepends(get_config), cfg2 = Depends(get_config)):\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise thanks a lot for working on this, not an easy one and I am really looking forward for this feature <3\nYeah, I totally understand on:\r\n- Wanting this to be tied to startup/shutdown\r\n- Wanting to specify the lifetime on the dependency side\r\n\r\nThe _main_ reason I'm not doing it like that is that:\r\n- There is no DI integration into startup/shutdown\r\n- The DI system currently relies on specifying things on the caller's side (eg. `use_cache`)\r\n\r\nAnd so doing it this way allowed me to do it in relatively few lines of code, with no major refactors, while still satisfying all of _my_ needs.\r\nI think trying to hit either of those other two features would require more extensive refactors (although maybe I'm just not familiar enough with the codebase).\r\n\r\nI do think there's some use for both, I can see scenarios where it is desirable to lazily initialize lifetime dependencies.\r\n\r\n> I would prefer having a factory function handling this\r\n\r\nThat does seem like a cleaner short term solution. We could also do this in the FastAPI codebase, something similar is already being done for `param_functions.Security`. To go one step further, we could not even have the `lifetime` parameter in `param_functions.Depends` and instead set it up like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef Depends(  # unchanged\r\n    dependency: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None, *, use_cache: bool = True\r\n) -> Any:\r\n    return params.Depends(dependency=dependency, use_cache=use_cache)\r\n\r\ndef AppDepends(\r\n    dependency: Optional[Callable[..., Any]] = None, *, use_cache: bool = True\r\n) -> Any:\r\n    return params.Depends(dependency=dependency, use_cache=use_cache, lifetime=\"app\")\r\n```\nhello! I'd highly recommend using the `Starlette(lifespan=...)` interface for this so people can create `anyio.TaskGroup`s in their lifespan dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo support this, `lifespan` was changed in 0.16.0 to only support async context manager factories, eg using `@contextlib(2).asynccontextmanager`.\r\n\r\nAnother change about this is that the `yield` statement can now throw an instance of `anyio.get_cancelled_exc_class()` eg:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@contextlib.asynccontextmanager\r\nasync def TaskGroup() -> AsyncGenerator[anyio.TaskGroup, None, None]:\r\n    async with anyio.create_task_group() as tg:\r\n        yield tg  #  <- this might throw asyncio.CancelledError or trio.CancelledError!\r\n```\r\n\n> The second bigger problem is that Statlette can't have both `Starlette(startup=[...])` and `Starlette(lifespan=...)` at the same time, if we add a `lifespan` argument we would disable users existing startup/shutdown hooks, which would break a lot of code.\n\nThe startup and shutdown hooks are merely shimmed by the default starlette lifespan context manager (see encode/starlette#799), now. There's nothing stopping FastAPI from adding a custom lifespan handler to take care of lifespan dependencies that also shims the old startup and shutdown events.\n@graingert I pushed a version using `Starlette(lifespan=...)` in \r\n629e465\r\n@sm-Fifteen you're right, thanks for the recommendation. I ended up with this shim: https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/629e465d7afe8fac442066c62f2897455f5198f8/fastapi/routing.py#L454-L479 I think the only tricky bit left is that whenever FastAPI enables `FastAPI(lifespan=...)` we'll have to handle adding the user's lifespan into this glue lifespan (I suppose checking if it is a context manager or generator, etc.).\nAlrighty folks, some exciting news, I reworked this to support dependencies in startup/shutdown events (and also in lifespan managers, whenever we update to `starlette=0.16.0`)\r\n\r\nI decided to keep this in the same PR since:\r\n1. The underlaying implementation using the lifespan AsyncExitStack is shared.\r\n2. The question of caching/sharing deps between lifespan/startup events and endpoints naturally arises, and is addressed using the original mechanism of this PR.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate on (2), I renamed the parameter `Depends(..., lifespan=\"app\")` to `Depends(..., cache_lifespan=\"app\")`, which not only more accurately reflects what it is doing, but also gives users the ability to choose if they want to cache startup/lifespan dependencies to be shared with endpoints or not. Endpoints also always have the option of using `Depends(..., cache=False)` to independently disable caching of a particular dependency for a particular endpoint.\r\n\r\nI still need to update the docs, but I have basic tests for most of the behavior described above. Here's a sample usage:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\r\nfrom typing import Generator\r\n\r\nfrom fastapi import Depends, FastAPI\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Database:\r\n\r\n    @contextmanager\r\n    def connect(self):\r\n        yield\r\n\r\n\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef DBConnection(config: AppConfig = Depends(Config)) -> Generator[Database, None, None]:\r\n    print(\"Creating DB connection!\")\r\n    db = Database()\r\n    with db.connect():\r\n        yield db\r\n\r\n\r\ndef startup(conn: Database = Depends(DBConnection, cache_lifespan=\"app\")):\r\n    await conn.execute(\"SELECT 1;\")  # or maybe some other DB health check\r\n\r\napp = FastAPI()\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.get(\"/\")\r\ndef root(conn: Database = Depends(DBConnection)):\r\n    ...  # conn is the same object startup got, and db.connect() is only called once during startup\r\n```\nThe wording change goes a long way to make the changes fit more cleanly in the current model, since they would allow deprecating/replacing the current `use_cache` parameter and establishes a clear mental model of what should happen if the same dependency is called with or without that parameter (or with different values). While it doesn't change my reservations about how caller-side vs function-side lifespan specifications, this has the potential to work well enough in more varied use cases and would be easy to tutorialize on top of the existing dependency stuff, so I'm willing to give it a go.\r\n\r\nA few things I should note, though:\r\n* Like with all forms of shared resources (whether passed as dependencies or from global scope), users should ensure that any resource managed this way is both thread-safe and coroutine-safe (one does not always imply the other, see the issues raised with `scoped_session` in https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/726#issuecomment-868750382)\r\n* Like I mention in the \"Additional context\" part of my original post for https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/617#issue-506258325, the user should be aware that the shutdown phase is not strictly guaranteed to run if the server doesn't get to exit cleanly (so that they can make sure that leftover database connections [time out properly when that happens instead of remaining open forever by default](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-IDLE-IN-TRANSACTION-SESSION-TIMEOUT), among other things).\r\n* Starlette currently has a problem with lifetime on mounted subapplications (encode/starlette#649) so you might want to either have a backup mechanism in case lifetime didn't fire properly or somehow disallow lifetime deps on sub-applications somehow.\r\n\nThanks for your work on this feature, I'm really exited to use it.\r\n\r\nThere's some issues with lifespan and multiple threads exacerbated by the starlette.TestClient: https://github.com/django/asgiref/pull/277\r\n\r\nAnd there's some additional issues with Trio and AsyncExitStack: https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/1243\n> The wording change goes a long way to make the changes fit more cleanly in the current model\r\n\r\n👍 glad it helps!\r\n\r\n> allow deprecating/replacing the current use_cache\r\n\r\nHmm I was thinking these would work in tandem.

I think there's not much we can do about this other than write good documentation, right?\r\n\r\n> user should be aware that the shutdown phase is not strictly guaranteed to run if the server doesn't get to exit cleanly\r\n\r\nAgreed again. But also documentation right?\r\n\r\nIf I am misunderstanding and either of these have implementation implications, please let me know.\r\n\r\n> Starlette currently has a problem with lifetime on mounted subapplications (...) you might want to either have a backup mechanism in case lifetime didn't fire properly\r\n\r\nThis seems like something where we should let Starlette resolve it (maybe holding off on implementing this feature until they do if it's a deal breaker), not something FastAPI should be working around.\n>  If those two parts could be welded wold put back together, I feel like we'd have a much more solid mechanism for managing lifetime-scoped ressources than the current one. \r\n\r\nAfaik this is exactly the fix I did here https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/1227\nThank you @graingert\r\n\r\nI do agree that the `give me a context manager as a lifespan handler` approach is much, much better than startup/shutdown events. And, as far as I can tell, this PR will be compatible with it with minimal changes (once FastAPI updates it's Starlette version).\n> https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/617#issuecomment-548465697\r\n> > If those two parts could be welded wold put back together, I feel like we'd have a much more solid mechanism for managing lifetime-scoped ressources than the current one.\r\n> \r\n> Afaik this is exactly the fix I did here [encode/starlette#1227](https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/1227)\r\n\r\nAh, I thought encode/starlette#799 had already managed this, but I guess forcing the use of context managers instead of generators could make everything more robust in a bunch of cases (hard to say from the code diff alone).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> > the user should be aware that the shutdown phase is not strictly guaranteed to run if the server doesn't get to exit cleanly\r\n> \r\n> This should no longer be true with Starlette 0.16.0. if the lifespan startup hook completes the lifespan shutdown hook will certainly be called. (Unless the thread is aborted with os._exit or get_event_loop().run_until_complete \"Pending task was destroyed!\" is used)\r\n\r\nThat's what I was referring to. VSCode will immediately kill your process [if stopped via the debugger's stop button](golang/vscode-go#120) (I'm not sure whether or not the Python extension still does it), and I've had that issue bite me more than once. Non-graceful shutdowns happen, so I figure that's something to be aware of.\r\n\r\n\r\n> > allow deprecating/replacing the current use_cache\r\n> \r\n> Hmm I was thinking these would work in tandem. One establishing the lifespan, another if caching should be used at all or not.\r\n\r\nAh, I figured that's what ~~`cache_lifespan=None`~~ `cache_lifespan=False` (`None` seems like a better parameter type to use) was supposed to be for.\r\n\r\n> > users should ensure that any resource managed this way is both thread-safe and coroutine-safe\r\n> \r\n> Agreed.

But also documentation right?\r\n\r\nYes, both of these were highlighted more in regards to documentation than to code, given how there's not really anything that can realistically be done at runtime for either of those issues.\r\n\r\n> > Starlette currently has a problem with lifetime on mounted subapplications (...) you might want to either have a backup mechanism in case lifetime didn't fire properly\r\n> \r\n> This seems like something where we should let Starlette resolve it (maybe holding off on implementing this feature until they do if it's a deal breaker), not something FastAPI should be working around.\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm not sure what to do in that regard here either. On one hand, it may lead to unexpected application breakage, on the other hand I don't know if that use-case is enough of a roadblock to put this feature on hold until the upstream bug gets resolved, given it's been sitting untouched for almost 2 years.\n> I figured that's what cache_lifespan=None cache_lifespan=False (None seems like a better parameter type to use) was supposed to be for.\r\n\r\nI actually like the idea of replacing `cache=False` with `cache_lifespan=None`. But I think it would break backwards compatibility / we'd have to figure out what to do if `cache_lifespan=None, cache=True`.\nSeems like something akin to pytest.fixture scope might work? Maybe with an Enum instead?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Scope(enum.Enum):\r\n    lifespan = enum.auto()\r\n    request = enum.auto()\r\n```\r\n\r\n?\n> I actually like the idea of replacing `cache=False` with `cache_lifespan=None`. But I think it would break backwards compatibility / we'd have to figure out what to do if `cache_lifespan=None, cache=True`.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've seen elsewhere, you usually check for the new parameter (`cache_lifespan=None`) first and use it if it's set, and then either ignore the old one, emit a deprecation warning or throw if both happen to be set. Given how `use_cache` currently has a default value of `True`, `cache_lifespan` could default to `Ellipsis` (unset, aliasing to `'request'` by default) so FastAPI can check if it has been set intentionally or not, and have it take priority over `use_cache` if it's is set (by the application programmer) to something else.\n> Seems like something akin to pytest.fixture scope might work? Maybe with an Enum instead?\r\n\r\nThat could work, but it would add an extra import.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it seems like the use of enum and/or replacing `cache: bool = {True,False}` seem totally doable, albeit minor things that don't change the fundamentals of the proposed change. I'm going to hold off on those changes until we can get review from @tiangolo  / more clarity on the viability of the PR in general.\r\n\n> This strategy of using a task for each fixture (read Dependency lifespan) has a number of benefits, it means task group and cancel scopes work as expected and it means that you can execute startup and shutdown handlers concurrently\r\n\r\nInteresting. I will have to do a bit more reading / give this some more thought, I'm not super familiar with some of this stuff, especially anyio (I'm just a vanilla asyncio user). If you prefer, please feel free to jump in and commit changes instead of holding my hand.",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR outlines the implementation of dependency management for both synchronous and asynchronous yield dependencies in FastAPI, particularly for startup and shutdown events. The key requirement is to create an `AsyncContextStack` dependency linked to app lifecycle management. The binding process is complicated due to conflicts with Starlette’s existing event management—specifically, setting `on_startup` in conjunction with `Starlette(lifespan=...)` raises errors. \n\nA notable concern is how dependencies may conflict if requested in different scopes, potentially resulting in either cached or new instances. To rectify this, a `lifetime` parameter may be added to dependency cache keys, allowing for better control over caching behavior. \n\nThe implementation currently avoids integrating direct dependency management via lifecycle protocols, proposing a factory function `AppDepends` instead. The PR further improves documentation clarity around thread-safety and coroutine-safety, acknowledging the need for careful resource use. Finally, it suggests handling potential issues with Starlette's lifetime on mounted sub-applications by awaiting resolution from upstream."

I am not sure which dependancy is at fault for it so I haven't made an issue. I assume it will be fixed in beta/release version of async alchemy.\nSQLAlchemy released a 2nd beta and from my testing everything seems to be working.\r\n\r\n\r\n@yenchenLiu Could you install `SQLAlchemy==1.4.0b2 ` and check if the error happens, if yes could you link the code? Can't replicate it as of right now.\nDid a quick test but SQLAlchemy complained that the default sqlite driver was not async. Does there even exist an async sqlite driver?\nFYI: [SQLAlchemy 1.4](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/blog/2021/03/15/sqlalchemy-1.4.0-released/) has just been released.\r\n\r\n@jokull from the release docs I think not:\r\n\r\n> Complete support for Python asyncio for both Core and ORM. This new system leverages the greenlet context-switching library to adapt the entirety of SQLAlchemy to be usable behind a very thin asyncio front-end while operating directly against asyncio database drivers within the asyncio event loop, with no need for thread executors. Support for **asyncpg** and **aiomysql** is included so far **with more drivers in development**.\r\n\r\n\nHi @ArcLightSlavik, \r\n\r\nI tried this with PostgreSQL in the past (1.4.0b1) and with SQLAlchemy 1.4.1 today, and it doesn't work properly as @yenchenLiu mentions.\r\n\r\nA workaround I found is to use `lazy='subquery'` or `lazy='selectin'` in `items` relationship. Example:\r\n\r\n`items = relationship(\"Item\", back_populates=\"owner\", lazy='subquery')`\r\n\r\nAlso is necessary to remove `\"check_same_thread\"` parameter from `create_async_engine` when PostgreSQL is used.\n@kurtrottmann indeed. Relationships don't work quite the same in async mode as stated in the async sqlalchemy documentation: [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/asyncio.html#preventing-implicit-io-when-using-asyncsession)\nThank you so much @ArcLightSlavik for writing this! It was instrumental in my attempt to get the async ORM working in my app. I hope this makes it to the official docs soon so others can benefit from it.\r\n\r\nAlso thanks to @kurtrottmann for your tips, they likely saved me a lot of time. I have several levels of nested relationships in my app, so I ended up declaring my relationships using `backref` and `lazy=joined`. Example:\r\n\r\n```items = relationship(\"Item\", backref=\"owner\", lazy='joined')```\r\n\r\nI did that because putting `lazy` in both sides of the `back_populates` relationship slowed the query down enormously. Maybe that's documented somewhere, but I didn't see it after doing a lot of reading, so I discovered the hard way that `lazy` should only be included on one side of the relationship. Declaring the relationship once with `backref` instead of twice with `back_populates` makes this more straightforward to me and my team (no need to question why the two sides of a relationship declaration have differing numbers of parameters, and a lot fewer lines of code to maintain across our many models).\n@ArcLightSlavik i have ready to use here solution: https://github.com/grillazz/fastapi-sqlalchemy-asyncpg\r\nif you dont mind i can polish this PR and add missing parts \nThe get_db dependency causes a weird \r\n`TypeError: <async_generator object get_db at 0x7ff6d9d9aa60> is not a callable object`\r\nissue on my project.\r\n\r\nHere's my code:\r\n\r\n**db.py**\r\n```\r\nfrom typing import Generator\r\nfrom .db.session import SessionLocal\r\n\r\nasync def get_db() -> Generator:\r\n    try:\r\n        db = SessionLocal()\r\n        yield db\r\n    finally:\r\n        await db.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**session.py**\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession\r\nfrom .core.config import settings\r\n\r\nengine = create_async_engine(\r\n    settings.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI,\r\n    pool_pre_ping=True\r\n)\r\nSessionLocal = AsyncSession(\r\n    autocommit=False,\r\n    autoflush=False,\r\n    bind=engine\r\n)\r\n```\n@joweenflores below is working well for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom typing import AsyncGenerator\r\nfrom sqlalchemy.exc import SQLAlchemyError\r\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine\r\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\r\n\r\nfrom the_app import config\r\n\r\nglobal_settings = config.get_settings()\r\nurl = global_settings.asyncpg_url\r\n\r\nengine = create_async_engine(\r\n    url,\r\n    echo=True,\r\n)\r\n\r\n# expire_on_commit=False will prevent attributes from being expired\r\n# after commit.\r\nasync_session = sessionmaker(engine, expire_on_commit=False, class_=AsyncSession)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Dependency\r\nasync def get_db() -> AsyncGenerator:\r\n    session = async_session()\r\n    try:\r\n        yield session\r\n        await session.commit()\r\n    except SQLAlchemyError as ex:\r\n        await session.rollback()\r\n        raise ex\r\n    finally:\r\n        await session.close()\r\n```",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment reflects ongoing issues with the MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) backend compatibility in the Whisper model. Key concerns include the lack of support for several PyTorch operators on MPS, particularly `aten::repeat_interleave.self_int`, causing a fallback to CPU execution which negatively impacts performance. Users have encountered multiple errors when running Whisper with MPS, including tensor size mismatches and memory allocation failures.\n\nSpecific implementation suggestions involve switching to a more recent nightly version of PyTorch, which may offer improved MPS compatibility, particularly for the unsupported `repeat_interleave` operator. Additionally, the necessity to avoid using FP16 precision has been highlighted, as it can lead to further issues on MPS.\n\nMoreover, users noted that MPS performance may lag behind CPU execution, raising architectural concerns about the efficiency of GPU utilization in this context. Optimal configurations should be explored to balance performance on both CPU and MPS."

strategy of advancing by the full 30 seconds to the next window whenever the current segment is unfinished. So basically, if the segment finishes before the end of the 30 second window, then Whisper will crop the window to the exact end timestamp of the last word in that segment. But if the segment does not finish by the end of the 30 second window, the window is not cropped, the speech is assumed to run all the way to the end of the window.\r\n\r\nThis logic exists whether or not the `hallucination_silence_threshold` is enabled, and I have seen it cause problems in both cases, however the larger models tend to be better at picking up the words across the window boundary.\r\n\r\nIn your case, the sentence in question is:\r\n\r\n> White tigers carry a mutated version of this gene, which prevents them from producing orange pigmentation.\r\n\r\nThis sentence does not fit within the 30 second window, and the word \"orange\" is right on the boundary. In fact, the word \"orange\" is slightly before the boundary and the human ear can pick it up (as can the larger models) but the smaller models fail to pick it up.\r\n\r\nAnd given Whisper's logic in this case, it will assume the speech went right up to the end of the 30 second window and will resume the next window from there.\r\n\r\nSo although yes the large models would probably resolve this, I think it would still be better to change Whisper's strategy and crop the window to the end timestamp of the last word even in this case where we have an unfinished segment.\n> This logic is part of the original Whisper strategy of advancing by the full 30 seconds to the next window whenever the current segment is unfinished.\r\n\r\nI can't connect the dots...\r\nThen why it's \"unfinished\" when using `hallucination_silence_threshold` and it's \"finished\" without it?\r\n\r\nHow `remaining_duration <= hallucination_silence_threshold` means an \"unfinished\" segment? The option doesn't read as \"finished/unfinished segment threshold\"....\r\n\nApologies, my explanation of that was around the wrong way. The original Whisper behaviour was that if the last segment in the window is \"complete\", THEN it skips to the end of the full 30 second window. If the last segment is incomplete, then it crops the window to end timestamp of the last word.\r\n\r\nBut when `hallucination_silence_threshold` is set, it still applies this logic in most cases except that it also includes a misfired heuristic that skips to the end of the full 30 second window if the end of the speech is close enough to the end of the window:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n                # skip silence before possible hallucinations\r\n                if hallucination_silence_threshold is not None:\r\n                    threshold = hallucination_silence_threshold\r\n                    if not single_timestamp_ending:\r\n                        last_word_end = get_end(current_segments)\r\n                        if last_word_end is not None and last_word_end > time_offset:\r\n                            remaining_duration = window_end_time - last_word_end\r\n                            if remaining_duration > threshold:  # <--- misfired heuristic\r\n                                seek = round(last_word_end * FRAMES_PER_SECOND)\r\n                            else:\r\n                                seek = previous_seek + segment_size\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe goal was to skip over as much silence as safely possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, in hindsight, this was a bit opportunistic, since after all `single_timestamp_ending` was `False` for good reason. You should find your example will work if you remove that heuristic. i.e. Delete this entire section:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n                    if not single_timestamp_ending:\r\n                        last_word_end = get_end(current_segments)\r\n                        if last_word_end is not None and last_word_end > time_offset:\r\n                            remaining_duration = window_end_time - last_word_end\r\n                            if remaining_duration > threshold:  # <--- misfired heuristic\r\n                                seek = round(last_word_end * FRAMES_PER_SECOND)\r\n                            else:\r\n                                seek = previous_seek + segment_size\r\n```\r\n\r\n(It's OK, the other parts of this code block are already handled elsewhere.)\nThanks for explanation, now this part of code makes sense.\r\nDo you have idea why seek in the last window can be affected by PR? -> https://github.com/openai/whisper/pull/1838#issuecomment-1960581637\r\n\r\n> The goal was to skip over as much silence as safely possible.\r\n\r\nImho, skipping to full 30s window is pretty unsafe.  😆\r\nAnd it contradicted the description: \"skip silent periods longer than this threshold (in seconds) **when a possible hallucination is detected**\"\n> Do you have an audio file to reproduce?\r\n\r\nThis file has discrepancy in the last window/chunk:\r\nt-001.mka -> https://we.tl/t-ecd6U1QaZp\r\n`--language en --model=base --beam_size 1 --word_timestamps=True`\r\n\r\nWhisper without this PR:\r\n```\r\n[01:53.920 --> 01:54.500]  I'll give you some advice.\r\n[01:59.500 --> 02:00.080]  I'll give you some advice.\r\n[02:00.080 --> 02:00.080]  I'll give you some advice.\r\n[02:00.080 --> 02:00.980]  Say the word, General.\r\n[02:02.300 --> 02:03.320]  Let him go.\r\n```\r\nWhisper with this PR:\r\n```\r\n[01:53.920 --> 01:55.200]  I'll give you some advice.\r\n[01:59.500 --> 02:00.980]  Say the word, General.\r\n[02:02.280 --> 02:03.320]  Let him go.\r\n```\r\n\n> I'll test tomorrow, but does this also happen on PR #2043 ?\r\n\r\nYes, because `hallucination_silence_threshold` option is not relevant for the issue.\r\n\r\nCulprit affecting only the last window is found. it happens because of this:\r\n```python\r\n            mel_segment = mel[:, seek : seek + segment_size]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the fix [that's how it was before this PR]:\r\n```python\r\n            mel_segment = mel[:, seek : seek + N_FRAMES]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure why you changed it, on my observation it makes more hallucinations [probably it's random].\r\nAnyway, the fix brings back the previous behavior.\nI've confirmed the discrepancy, which seems to be a consequence of slightly different mel spectrograms. Although in the two examples you gave (only the latter of which I have tested with the supplied audio file), the PR actually removed a hallucination on one example and introduced a hallucination on the other example. So on balance, it's hard to say whether this discrepancy it better or worse or about the same.\r\n\r\nSo if it's not clear whether it's better or worse, do you see anything incorrect in the clipping logic? I think the difference is that I am always clipping exactly to the stretch of audio being examined, and then padding it. But originally, there was padding on the end that was added immediately when the mel spectrogram was first generated, and then (in the original code), it is also possible that due to the dynamic shifting of the window starts, it could end up padding the last part of the audio twice, because there is no guarantee that that initial padding Whisper added at the start of the process was enough to reflect where this last window ended up actually starting.\r\n\r\nBut it's possible I've done something wrong which I can't see, so let me know if you do spot something incorrect in the logic.\nAfter plotting the mel spectrograms, I noticed the padding when the audio is first loaded (as a whole) contains all -1.0's, while the padding in the main loop for each 30 second window contains all 0.0's. Not sure why that is, but there are two different padding algorithms in the code, and weirdly they are producing different padding results.\r\n\r\nSo in your example, the PR ends up always using the padding algorithm that pads to 0.0's whereas originally the end of file padding had -1.0's. \nThere's still a chance that a hallucination will be produced.\r\nFor me it was:\r\n```\r\n[02:15:58.100 --> 02:16:05.380]  я вам вышлю.

You can tweak the silence threshold, which is exposed on the command line. You can also try tweaking the other thresholds that were built into the code (like how long a word must be before it is flagged as an abnormality). If we can gather a large enough dataset of audio samples that produce hallucinations, we should be able to come up with better default settings that work well across a variety of scenarios and languages.\n@ryanheise \r\nI was using a bit tweaked segment anomaly heuristics to reduce false-positives, didn't noticed increase of false-negatives:\r\n\r\nchanged\r\n `if duration < 0.133:`\r\nto:\r\n`if duration < 0.133 and probability < 0.8:`\r\n\r\nchanged\r\n`return score >= 3 or score + 0.01 >= len(words)`\r\nto:\r\n`return score >= 3 or score + 0.001 >= len(words)`\r\n\r\nWhat you think about this tweak?\nUnfortunately I'm between computers right now (my old computer died 2 weeks ago, and I'm just in the process of installing everything on the recently arrived replacement...)\r\n\r\n>  return score >= 3 or score + 0.001 >= len(words)\r\n\r\nI don't see any problem with that change.\r\n\r\n>  `if duration < 0.133 and probability < 0.8:`\r\n\r\nDo you have an example audio for this one?

    "summarized_comments": "The PR raises several specific technical issues primarily concerning handling hallucinations and segment processing in the Whisper model. A notable concern is that using the `--hallucination_silence_threshold` can lead to the omission of entire non-hallucinating segments, like \"orange pigmentation,\" due to mismanagement of segment completion logic. To address this, the implementation should be revised to ensure that windows are cropped to the last word's timestamp, regardless of whether the segment is deemed unfinished.\n\nA proposed code suggestion is to adjust the scoring condition in `is_segment_anomaly` to incorporate a margin for smaller parameters. Additionally, the final mel segment should revert to the previous clipping logic to eliminate current discrepancies in output. \n\nMoreover, the padding discrepancy between initial audio loading and processing needs investigation to prevent unnecessary hallucinations. Collecting more diverse audio samples to refine these heuristics would be beneficial. Actionable refinements should focus on solidifying segment analysis criteria and ensuring clarity in handling edge cases with silence thresholds."

The repetitions in this example are all \"instantaneous\" ; eg same start and end time\r\n> [02:14.720 --> 02:14.720] and needless to say, thank God, I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.\r\n\r\nthey are printed but then immediately cleared by this code, which looks like a bug unique to `--verbose True`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/aac47c98349b98cec5ca7b1be53960fb59f4436b/whisper/transcribe.py#L345\nThis is not a verbose error, and the start times and end times of repetition are not always instantaneous, see output for the .srt file without verbose:\r\n\r\n271\r\n00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,720\r\nand needless to say, thank God, I wasn't using a thesaurus back<u> then.</u>\r\n\r\n272\r\n00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:14,720\r\n\r\n\r\n273\r\n00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,180\r\n<u>I</u> mean from this entry, it would seem that\r\n\r\n274\r\n00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,360\r\nI<u> mean</u> from this entry, it would seem that\r\n\r\n275\r\n00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,960\r\nI mean<u> from</u> this entry, it would seem that\r\n\r\n276\r\n00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,220\r\nI mean from<u> this</u> entry, it would seem that\r\n\r\n277\r\n00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:17,620\r\nI mean from this<u> entry,</u> it would seem that\r\n\r\n278\r\n00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:17,800\r\nI mean from this entry, it would seem that\r\n>\nSo there are at least two problems then\r\n* verbose mode can print cleared segments\r\n* something else triggered by word_timestamps\r\n\r\nGiven how close the start/end times are it feels like something related to `seek_shift` is still off\r\nhttps://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/aac47c98349b98cec5ca7b1be53960fb59f4436b/whisper/transcribe.py#L337\r\n\r\n@m-bain Do the same repetitions happen with `word_timestamps False` or no? \nUpdate, I realise there is some specific underline formatting in the word_timestamps, was able to get it working in the end.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR highlights several technical issues affecting model performance, particularly with zero-padding in Mel spectrograms as noted in issues #730 and #838. While the latest commit (477f0be) resolves some repetition issues, using longer audio clips, such as \"AimeeMullins_2009P.wav,\" yields significant repetition, prompting further investigation. A key observation indicates that repetitions occur even outside verbose mode, particularly with timings that are not instantaneous, such as in the .srt file outputs. This suggests deeper underlying issues with the `seek_shift` logic, requiring scrutiny. Additionally, the code in verbose mode erroneously prints cleared segments, which is considered a bug. Lastly, the differences in word segmentation and timestamp accuracy were noted, raising concerns over achieving comparable results to existing implementations, such as the one by linto-ai. Requests for evaluation metrics regarding long-form transcription WER were also made."

The decoding logic is already taking as much as the forward pass, and I'm hoping to reduce this overhead. The subword token probabilities are not very useful anyway, because it's usually influenced more by language modeling than from speech recognition.\r\n\r\nFor the case you need per-token probs, you can add another forward pass without modifying decoding.py (similar to how it's done in [timing.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/76c901ab8d4558992c44138479c4d69eb52fadcb/whisper/timing.py#L197)) without incurring too much additional latency. It may even be faster than adding GPU operations for every autoregressive step.\r\n\r\nThe example script looks nifty, but i'd prefer it in the [show and tell](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) section.\n@SinanAkkoyun thanks for your contribution. Not sure, but seems it works incorrect, \r\nI made distorted speech example https://drive.google.com/file/d/12zGWllJg6edftcnwuHX_ZHMuwk7PlVjg/view?usp=sharing .\r\nIf I don't set the language of decoding i.e. `options = whisper.DecodingOptions() `,  the output is correct in terms of locating mispronounce (I can read this slavic) though it translates it to random language.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-08-09 10-58-49](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/54935496/cf45eaab-1799-45d0-a386-2fc2e3076b1a)\r\n\r\nBut if I set 'en' for decoding  `options = whisper.DecodingOptions(language=\"en\")` the picture is wrong.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-08-09 10-58-53](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/54935496/8c009a46-ec4d-4a47-abe3-786408580857)\r\n The rest of the code is the same as in your PR except I used \"small\" model.\r\n\n@Rtut654 Hi, I don't quite understand the issue you are having, the \"I like to play badminton and football.\" seems to be correct, the football especially sounds vague in the audio you provided. Could you please tell me more about your issue?\r\n\r\nDespite that, the PR is not going to get merged, so I stopped working on it and use that modification in my own work which does not include translation\r\n\r\nIf the random translation is the problem you are referring to, I believe that my PR did not modify nor change the output prediction by any means, it just grabbed the logits and displays them as confidence\n@SinanAkkoyun \r\nThe issue is in the accuracy of token_probs. The first version (with translation to Ukrainian) gives very accurate result since \"like\" was also mispronounced very much. Also the word \"football \" was mispronounced in the last part which is correctly shown in the first picture. \r\n\r\nI did the same test with other audio, setting language of decoding to English.  The picture was same. Somehow it is lowering the prob of the last word even when it is pronounced correctly. At the same time probs of mispronounciations were high which is strange. So something is wrong in the way it predicts probs when language is set to English.\nIn case it's of interest, I created a small web component to view the Whisper JSON file when `--word_timestamps` has been used. Ideas for improving it would be welcome!\r\n\r\nhttps://edsu.github.io/whisper-transcript/",

A key concern raised involves the need for a command line option to produce additional subtitle outputs, positing that this feature's utility is niche relative to existing functionalities like `word_timestamps=True`. The implementation includes colorful CLI output in an example but eschews it in the main codebase to maintain simplicity. \n\nA noteworthy architectural suggestion is to perform another forward pass for per-token probabilities akin to the existing method in timing.py, which could mitigate latency compared to extensive GPU operations. Additionally, there are concerns about the accuracy of token probabilities, particularly when set to English, leading to improper translations while correctly identifying mispronunciations. The suggestion is to review how token probabilities are influenced under different language settings, as discrepancies may indicate flaws in the decoding logic or language handling."

When adding a regular `primary_key=True` on a single field, a unique constraint is added. But when using this branch, it becomes an `IntegrityError` instead. Adding a `UniqueConstraint` on the composite fields is a work-a-round but ideally would be captured in this PR. Imo, this PR is sooooo close. I'm excited for it to be merged in.\n@grjones , thanks, I appreciate the feedback, I'll look into it. If a model defines `Meta.primary_key`, defining `primary_key=True` on a field should not be possible - could you give me a code example so I know how to reproduce the issue? I didn't know Django added unique constraints to primary keys, I'll check, but isn't that redundant?\n> @grjones , thanks, I appreciate the feedback, I'll look into it.

My \"unique constraint\" phrasing might not be exactly right. But ultimately, I believe Django queries the DB first to see if the new object's PK already exists and throws a validation error. The composite key logic doesn't seem to be doing that and so an unhandled IntegrityError is raised instead.\n> @grjones , sorry for the late reply, I've been busy last week. Could you give me more specifics? What's the error message you expect?\r\n\r\nActually, I think it's mostly ok.

If `Meta.primary_key` is defined, this PR will automatically add a composite field called `primary_key` to the model. What do you think about this approach? I felt like it was easier to handle the composite primary keys this way as we can run checks against the meta class instead of traversing the model's fields for a composite field.\r\n2. I wrote a lot of tests testing the underlying queries made by the ORM. It makes a lot of sense to me, but I haven't seen this type of tests that much in the Django source code - do these tests look okay to you?\n \r\n> If `Meta.primary_key` is defined, this PR will automatically add a composite field called `primary_key` to the model. What do you think about this approach?\r\n\r\nI don't feel strongly that this is better or worse than another option here, so happy to go with what you think is best.\r\n\r\n> I wrote a lot of tests testing the underlying queries made by the ORM. It makes a lot of sense to me, but I haven't seen this type of tests that much in the Django source code - do these tests look okay to you?\r\n\r\nI like your tests quite a bit - they're pretty readable and comprehensive. The main issue I have with them is that they're written for specific databases instead of for generic database features. Where possible Django strongly prefers to test based on features because then the tests apply to as many databases as possible (including third party database libraries). I think the asserts of the actual SQL might be a bit tricky to adapt though, so we might need a different way to check what they're checking.\r\n\r\nAlso, after I reviewed yesterday, I thought of some more things:\r\n\r\n* We should add migrations tests to make sure that adding/removing `Meta.primary_key` works correctly and that removing a field that's part of a primary key also does something appropriate.\r\n* We might want tests for composite keys in forms and the admin. Maybe there's other areas too that we need to check the interactions.\nThanks @charettes !\r\n\r\n> Something that came through my mind while reviewing is that we likely want a plan to eventually deprecate `Options.pk` in favor of `Options.primary_key`?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what you mean by that, I don't think we can, because `Options.pk` refers to the field, while `Options.primary_key` is the list of field names.\nSo as far as I understand, at the moment `MultiColSource` is used by Django internally to represent `JOIN`s on multiple fields - that's why it has a `sources` field.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's the right decision to reuse this for composite fields, which on the other hand don't need `sources`, it just needs to represent a list of `Col`s as an expression.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!\n> I'm not sure what you mean by that, I don't think we can, because Options.pk refers to the field, while Options.primary_key is the list of field names.\r\n\r\nYou're completely right. In this case is `pk` set to `CompositePrimaryKey` when `Meta.primary_key` is defined and is `primary_key` set when a non-composite primary is used as well?\n> > I'm not sure what you mean by that, I don't think we can, because Options.pk refers to the field, while Options.primary_key is the list of field names.\r\n> \r\n> You're completely right. In this case is `pk` set to `CompositePrimaryKey` when `Meta.primary_key` is defined and is `primary_key` set when a non-composite primary is used as well?\r\n\r\nIt would not be set, if it's a regular primary key, `Meta.primary_key` is `None`.\nHey @csirmazbendeguz, thank you for the amazing work out there! I was trying to test this branch on my local with SQLite and realised a few things:\r\n\r\n1. If you run `makemigrations` for a model with a `CompositePrimaryKey`, the resulting migration file has erroneous imports. To fix this, I believe we need to add `django.db.models.fields.composite` path to the `if...elif` block [here](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py#L645).\r\n2. Assume that I have the following models:\r\n\r\n    ```py\r\n    class Author(models.Model):\r\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\r\n\r\n    class Book(models.Model):\r\n        id = models.CompositePrimaryKey(\"author\", \"title\")\r\n        author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\"books\")\r\n        title = models.CharField(max_length=255)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    With the current implementation, following test fails:\r\n    ```py\r\n    class TestCompositeFks(TestCase):\r\n        def test_composite_fks(self):\r\n            author = Author.objects.create(name=\"Author\")\r\n            book = Book.objects.create(author=author, title=\"Title\")\r\n            list(Author.objects.filter(books__in=[book])) == book\r\n    ```\r\n    with an `OperationalError`, caused by a syntax error. Executed SQL is as following:\r\n    ```SQL\r\n    SELECT\r\n        \"books_author\".\"id\",\r\n        \"books_author\".\"name\"\r\n    FROM\r\n        \"books_author\"\r\n        INNER JOIN \"books_book\" ON (\"books_author\".\"id\" = \"books_book\".\"author_id\")\r\n    WHERE\r\n        \"books_book\".\"author_id\", \"books_book\".\"title\" IN ((1, 'Title'))\r\n    ```\r\n    because LHS in WHERE clause should have been wrapped with parantheses like this:\r\n    ```SQL\r\n    ...\r\n    WHERE\r\n        (\"books_book\".\"author_id\", \"books_book\".\"title\") IN ((1, 'Title'))\r\n    ```\r\n    Unfortunately I didn't have a time to deep-dive to this.\r\n3. Not a big issue but my code editor (VSCode) does not recognize `models.CompositePrimaryKey`, although the import is working fine. This is probably related with Pylance or something that VSCode uses to recognize fields under `models` module.\r\n\r\nAgain thanks for this amazing initiative! 🚀 \n@csirmazbendeguz Thanks for your answers, now the above issues seem like fixed, created migration is correct and reverse relation lookup is working as expected. Thank you! 🚀\r\n\r\nWhile I was testing it further with the exact [same models](https://github.com/django/django/pull/18056#issuecomment-2158820017), I realized another issue:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass TestCompositeFks(TestCase):\r\n    def test_composite_fks(self):\r\n        author = Author.objects.create(name=\"Author\")\r\n        Book.objects.create(author=author, title=\"Title\")\r\n        author = Author.objects.annotate(book_count=Count(\"books\")).get()\r\n        assert author.book_count == 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis test fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndjango.db.utils.OperationalError: wrong number of arguments to function COUNT()\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuted SQL is as following:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT\r\n    \"books_author\".\"id\",\r\n    \"books_author\".\"name\",\r\n    COUNT(\"books_book\".\"author_id\", \"books_book\".\"title\") AS \"book_count\"\r\nFROM\r\n    \"books_author\"\r\n    LEFT OUTER JOIN \"books_book\" ON (\"books_author\".\"id\" = \"books_book\".\"author_id\")\r\nGROUP BY\r\n    \"books_author\".\"id\",\r\n    \"books_author\".\"name\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we could change the parameter we pass to the `COUNT` function to a concatenation as below:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nCOUNT(\"books_book\".\"author_id\" || '-' || \"books_book\".\"title\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nit should work fine (if I am not missing something), with the exception that for some databases we need to use `CONCAT` function instead of `||` operator, which might be resolved using the existing `db.models.functions.Concat` function.\r\n\r\nNote: I am not sure if concatenation works between every data type that is allowed to be a primary key, although this could be considered as an edge case.\n@omerfarukabaci , I thought about the issue of `Count(\"books\")`.\r\n\r\nMy conclusion is we can't support this.\r\n\r\nI don't think concatenating is a good solution. The only way we could support this is if we could get Django to count this with `*` instead of the primary key.\r\n\r\nThis is an edge case that is only needed for `Count` though, and it's not as simple to implement as it is to explain.\r\n\r\nI added a section to the docs about this. This is a case of using a database function with a composite primary key directly, which cannot be expected to work in general.\r\n\r\nIn your case, `Count(\"books__author_id\")` would do the trick instead.\nRegarding the issue raised by @sarahboyce last week...\r\n\r\nI think it is okay to merge this without support for generic relations. I added a section to the docs about this not being supported for now.\r\n\r\nThe only impact is some third-party packages using generic relations won't work with composite primary keys (e.g. `django-guardian`).\r\n\r\nLet's have a separate discussion on how to support this. I lean towards storing composite primary keys serialized as JSON in a single CharField.\nBtw, semantically it would be nice if it were possible to write:\r\n```python \r\nclass User(models.Model):\r\n    pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey(\"tenant_id\", \"id\")\r\n    tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n    id = models.IntegerField()\r\n```\r\n\r\nie to let `CompositePrimaryKey` replace the automatically generated `pk`. Would that be possible?\n> Btw, semantically it would be nice if it were possible to write:\r\n> \r\n> ```python\r\n> class User(models.Model):\r\n>     pk = models.CompositePrimaryKey(\"tenant_id\", \"id\")\r\n>     tenant = models.ForeignKey(Tenant, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n>     id = models.IntegerField()\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ie to let `CompositePrimaryKey` replace the automatically generated `pk`. Would that be possible?\r\n\r\n@apollo13 , good point! It also came up when we were discussing this with @LilyFoote and @charettes . It seems like a natural thing to do, so it's worth a discussion. Here are a couple ideas that make sense to me:\r\n\r\n1. `pk` at the moment is reserved, users can't add a field named `pk`. We could remove this restriction.\r\n2. If `pk` is defined, it should always set `primary_key=True`.\r\n3. If `pk` is not defined, it should still refer to the `primary_key=True` field (e.g. `id` field). This is required for backwards-compatibility.\r\n4. If `pk` is defined, and it's an `IntegerField`, then a field called `pk` should be created in the database (same as any field, e.g. `id`).\r\n5. If `pk` is defined, and it's a `CompositePrimaryKey`, then a field called `pk` shouldn't be created in the database (same as any field, e.g. `primary_key`).\r\n\r\nMy only issue with this is, it adds extra complexity to how `pk` works. In this case, `pk` can be both a reference to the primary key field, or the primary key field itself.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure if it's worth doing this. It doesn't feel like an elegant or consistent solution to me.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe other approach @charettes and @LilyFoote mentioned is to always have `pk` be a `CompositePrimaryKey` (could be renamed to `PrimaryKey`):\r\n\r\n1. `pk` cannot be defined explicitly.\r\n2. `CompositePrimaryKey` cannot be used explicitly.\r\n3. `pk` is _always_ added to the model in the background, and it's _always_ an instance of `CompositePrimaryKey`.\r\n4. Consequently, `pk` will cease to be a reference to another field, it will always be a field itself.\r\n5. If field `x` defines `primary_key=True`, `pk` is `CompositePrimaryKey(\"x\")`. `obj.pk` returns the value of `x` for backwards-compatibility (instead of a tuple).\r\n6. If `Meta.primary_key` option is `(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")`, `pk` is `CompositePrimaryKey(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")`. `obj.pk` returns a tuple.\r\n7. If `Meta.primary_key` is not set, it could be set to `(\"x\",)` automatically.\r\n\r\nThis is quite an invasive change. It would mean all existing models get a new field called `pk`.\r\n`meta.pk` would return a different field. Instead of `IntegerField`, it would return `CompositePrimaryKey`. Is breaking backwards-compatibility okay here?\r\n\r\nI don't have anything against it other than that. It does feel more intuitive. If the community wants this, I could fork this branch and open another PR.",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR introduces a feature for composite primary keys but reveals several critical issues that need addressing. An error during testing indicates that Python's `in` lookup fails because the right-hand side must be an iterable, as shown when using `isnull`. Specifically, the following query fails due to this error:\n\n```python\nMyModel.objects.filter(type_override__severity__isnull=False).update(severity=\"high\")\n```\n\nFurther, the implementation currently raises an `IntegrityError` when establishing unique constraints on composite fields, which should ideally be captured in the PR. \n\nConcerns were also raised about the SQL generated for queries with composite keys, such as incorrect syntax causing `OperationalError`. The SQL's COUNT function doesn't support composite keys as implemented, which could be rectified by using `Count(\"books__author_id\")`. \n\nAdditionally, there are migration issues related to erroneous imports and a failure to accurately manage composite primary key migrations, needing a review of the import statement path.\n\nLastly, suggestions for proper handling of `pk` in models indicate that it would be beneficial to simplify its semantics for clarity and usability."

I suggest we keep the possibility of Django fetching fields by *_id using get_field(), but we remove duplicates in field_names\n\n@PirosB3 What's the hold-up in using `_meta.fields` as the main (and only) entry point? Is that backward compatibility because `fields` doesn't have \"fake\" fields like reverse relations?\n\nIf that's the case I think we have here a unique opportunity to get it right and it's easy enough to provide an upgrade path.\n",

I would also recommend to remove current implementation from `contrib.postgres` and for backward compatibility leave it only as a reference to a new implementation (probably some workaround should be added to migrations):\r\n\r\n- `django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField` -> `django.db.models.JSONField`,\r\n- `django.contrib.postgres.forms.JSONField` -> `django.forms.JSONField`,\r\n\r\nFor example, `django/contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py`:\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.db.models import JSONField\r\n\r\n__all__ = ['JSONField']\r\n```\r\nall lookups should be moved from `contrib/postgres/fields/jsonb.py`  to `db/models/lookups.py`.\r\n\r\nWith these changes we will be able to find caveats for each database :male_detective: .\n@felixxm I remember some folks saying it'd be better to leave the current implementation in `contrib.postgres` as it is (and add a deprecation message). However, I see your idea is reasonable, as long as we can maintain all of the lookups and transforms. I guess I'll try going down that route and see if we can do that.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I've removed some tests in `postgres_tests` and incorporated them into `test_jsonfield.py`.\r\n\r\nSome updates:\r\n\r\n- `JSON_VALID(NULL)` returns `0` (false) on SQLite, while it returns true on MySQL and MariaDB (or maybe the check just doesn't occur). This makes it impossible to store SQL `NULL` even if we specify `blank=True, null=True`. I've updated the SQLite constraint with `OR \"%(column)s\" IS NULL` and now it works correctly.\r\n- Oracle Database stores SQL `NULL` as an empty string `''` on fields that support empty strings. I've updated `JSONField` to accommodate this behavior. Saving empty Python strings would still work, as they would be encoded as `'\"\"'`.\r\n- I've refactored the tests into different classes for cohesiveness.\nApparently, it's not because the values aren't quoted.  \r\ncx_Oracle uses bind variables:  \r\nhttps://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/dsl/prez-python-queries-101587.html\r\nhttps://oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plsql/bind/\r\n\r\nBasically, query parameters get passed using variables, so queries look like this on Oracle:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE col1 = :arg1 AND col2 = :arg2 ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the arguments can be passed using a dictionary, kwargs, or sequence (list, tuple), e.g.\r\n```python\r\nparams = {'arg1': 'hello', 'arg2': 'world'}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(see also: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/oracle/base.py#L478)\r\n\r\nThe problem is, `JSON_EXISTS` function on Oracle [doesn't support bind variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48913687/jdbc-prepared-statement-to-query-json-using-json-exists). We can format the arguments directly into the SQL string (which is what I've done), but this opens up the possibility of SQL injections.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do `json.dumps()` on the specified key before formatting it, so the key will be double-quoted. If someone were to execute an SQL injection, they should end the quote first, which I don't think is possible since `\"` will be escaped by `json.dumps()` into `\\\"`. I think the worst that could happen is a `DatabaseError`. I currently can't think of a key string that can be used to perform an SQL injection.\r\n\r\nShould we go through with it, or drop support for these lookups on Oracle?\r\n\r\n\nThanks a lot for the feedback. I started working on the lookups and transforms on MySQL using @adamchainz's and @raphaelm's existing code. It turns out that the code doesn't pass all of the tests from `contrib.postgres`, so I still have to fix things up.\r\n\r\nI also try to simplify or find better ways to implement the lookups and transforms, but fixing one thing tends to break another. It's very confusing, to be honest. Not to mention debugging it isn't so easy since I have to inspect the queries most of the time... :grimacing: \r\n\r\nEdit: on the other hand, `TestQuerying` test cases aren't run by djangoci. What's up with that?\nI've implemented the transforms and lookups on Oracle. Some features aren't supported, so I skipped the tests for those on Oracle.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n- I didn't choose to implement it using the simple dot-notation syntax.\r\n  It's mainly because it requires the tables to be given aliases in the query. I could not find an easy and clean way to do that. The [oracle_json_field](https://github.com/Exscientia/oracle-json-field/blob/master/oracle_json_field/managers.py) package uses a custom Queryset and Manager with forced self-join to make table aliases.\r\n- In effect, I had to use `JSON_QUERY` to retrieve JSON objects and arrays, and `JSON_VALUE` to retrieve scalar values. To combine this, I used `COALESCE`. I probably should use `models.functions.Coalesce` for this, but if that's the case, it would make sense to also write `JSON_QUERY` and `JSON_VALUE` functions. It would probably add a little overhead on the Python-side. I'm not sure if I should do this. If I should, I'll probably also write some JSON `Func`s for all database backends that support them. For now, I'm just writing `COALESCE` directly into the SQL.\r\n- On the upside, using `JSON_QUERY` and `JSON_VALUE` supports querying > 4 KBytes of data while using the dot-notation syntax does not.\nI've implemented the transforms and lookups on SQLite. It turns out I can reuse most of the code from MySQL implementation. I only had to handle the case for querying JSON `null` values in JSON objects to differentiate them from missing keys (by using the `JSON_TYPE` function).\r\nSurprisingly, the support is equivalent to MySQL, which is much better than on Oracle.\r\n\r\nI have also added tests for storing JSON `null` scalar values. It is possible to do so by using `Value` during object creation. However, the Python representation of SQL `NULL` and JSON `null` are the same, i.e. `None`.\nI think I've found a way to implement `contains` and `contained_by` on SQLite and Oracle. I'll see what I can do.\nI managed to get `contains` working on SQLite and Oracle, though it was a bit of a hack since they both don't include a function similar to `JSON_CONTAINS`. It seems to work fine for its intended use (a `dict` rhs, to be checked on the top level of the JSON document). I added more tests, but I cannot guarantee it to work uniformly across all backends, especially for scalar and array rhs.\r\n\r\nEdit: I cannot think of a way to implement `contained_by`. Without a `JSON_CONTAINS` function, one would need to enumerate the JSON document in the database, which I think is impossible to do in one query.",
    "sumarized_length": 1694,
    "summarized_comments": "This PR highlights several key implementation concerns related to JSON support across various database backends—specifically for the `supports_json` feature in Django.\n\n1. **Database Version Compatibility**: The update supports MariaDB 10.2.24, which introduces `has_json_field`. Consider using a feature flag for databases like SQLite and Oracle, as JSON handling differs significantly across systems.\n\n2. **SQLite JSON1 Extension**: There are challenges determining the presence of the JSON1 extension in older SQLite versions. Suggestions include executing `SELECT json('\"test\"')` as a fallback to handle unsupported situations. However, a cleaner method would be utilizing `PRAGMA compile_options`.\n\n3. **Error Handling Strategies**: There's debate over using `check` to extend method returns rather than raising `NotSupportedError`. Testing reveals potential issues with SQLite returning `0` for `JSON_VALID(NULL)`, which complicates storing SQL `NULL`. To address this, the constraint update to include checking for `NULL` explicitly could yield more consistent behavior.\n\n4. **Oracle JSON Handling**: Concerns arise from the `JSON_EXISTS` function lacking support for bind variables, raising potential SQL injection risks. Recommendations include sanitizing inputs with `json.dumps()` to mitigate risks, but further review may be warranted to determine if support should be dropped. \n\n5. **Proposed Structural Changes**: There's a push to migrate JSONField functionality from `contrib.postgres` to `django.db.models` for a unified approach, enhancing maintainability. This involves class method restructuring and consideration of backward compatibility.\n\n6. **Current Testing Concerns**:"

    "unsumarized_comments": "I've made error message single-line so there is no short/long description separation. See https://github.com/chrismedrela/django/commit/1929a8c3565bdd6aa36b8ce3f578f34091105d59.\n\nIt is great to see validation.py get replaced with something far more sane - and I think the overall approach is good.\n\nIn addition to my line level comments - here are some overall thoughts:\n\nThere are a number of places where related field checks are skipped if the the value is a string - I'm assuming for lazy resolution. Shouldn't we be in a position by the time checks are done to have all related fields connected? It seems that potential problems that are checked for are now deferred to runtime leaving users with \"why did this setup pass checks and now bombs?\"\n\nI wish there was a way to test this without the brittle problem of doing essentially string comparisons on the error messages. Any typo fixes or rewording means updating the docs. Unfortunately I don't have any bright ideas. When hitting a similar situation for SuspiciousOperation the solution was to create specific subclasses - but that seems like the wrong type of fix here.\n\nThere is a bit too much opaque use of **kwargs being passed around - it is fine for this, but if the design of this feature were to be much more complex than it is, it would be an ass-biting laying in wait.\n\nAs said in a comment, I think the \"check_all_models\" adds enough enhancement and exposes enough checking API for this feature without also adding the global \"registration\" of custom check functions.\n\nThe docs will need some more polish (I'm willing to help - left no comments yet), and actual deprecations need to be started.\n\nI'm NOT NOT NOT a coverage zealot but I did run my little diff coverage tool on the branch which found the following lines that were added/changed that are not tested:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/ptone/fa491c101de3bc4fc5c7\nhttp://ptone.com/temp/checks-coverage/ (untested changes have block red line numbers)\n\n100% coverage should not be a blind objective, but it can be helpful for you to see any major untested areas, but overall the tests looked good.\n\nThanks for the tremendous amount of work during your GSOC.\n\nThanks for the review, Preston -- much appreciated to have another set of eyes on the codebase.\n\nRegarding the string resolution of related field names -- that's mostly inherited from the old codebase -- Chris hasn't introduced anything new there. You're completely correct that at the point checks are performed, all the models _should_ be resolved. I'll stand corrected on this, but as I recall, the reason the string exclusions exist is so that when a bad model has been referenced, we can catch the fact that it hasn't been resolved, report that problem, and then perform any other checks that are appropriate. However, some checks will break hard if the foreign key reference hasn't been resolved, so you need to skip over those checks.\n\nRegarding the tests checking string content -- I agree that isn't ideal. A stretch goal for this project is to enable pyflakes-style warning/error suppression -- so you'll be able to register that you don't care about E115, and have errors of that type suppressed. This will also give us a simple constant against which we can perform tests. \n\nThe *_kwargs usage is a 'room for expansion' thing, much like the use of *_kwargs on save(). The idea is that you might be able to pass in specific qualifiers or modifiers to the checks; we don't know exactly what they will be -- one use at the moment is \"the app name\", but there could be others. Requiring **kwargs in the prototype for check methods means any future flags will be silently ignored, but can be specifically catered for when appropriate.\n\nAdding custom check functions was a specific goal for the project, with security checks being the use case validating the need for the feature. \n\nCompletely agreed on docs needing polish before this is merged -- that's true of any project, however. I'll certainly remember to call on you when we get to a merge point :-) \n\nThanks for the hit list on coverage, too. My validation to date has been a line-for-line comparison with the old validation checks; that means we should be at least as covered as we were previously, but doesn't account for previously existing testing holes.\n\nAm I correct that this issue implies that a default value should always be set, and that this could be a check added to BooleanField?\n\nhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/1466/files\n\n@loic, thank you for your input. I've had a look at these wiki pages, but I think that we will stay with \"system checks\" -- I cannot see any option that is _much_ better.\n\nOne thing I'm curious about: how should we (whether that's Django or third-parties) decide what validation should be done by this checking process, and what should be done in `__init__()`? A number of fields do checks in `__init__()` and raise exceptions there - for example, `FileField` will raise a `TypeError` from `__init__()` if you try to pass it a `unique` argument, but it will not check `upload_to` until model checking.\n\nSince `__init__()` is always run, while model checking is generally only run in development, it would seem that this distinction matters most in a production environment. Since model checking is skipped there, under the assumption that problems have already been addressed in development, perhaps the distinction should be that `__init__()` only does the validation necessary to make the code actually run, while all correctness checks are done by the checking process.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n@marfire I think you've found an unusual edge case of the old validation design.\n\nThe only examples of exceptions raised in `__init__()` that I can find are:\n- AutoField (rejecting `primary_key=False`), \n- FileField (rejecting `primary_key` and `unique` arguments). \n- ForeignKey/M2M (rejecting references to abstract models, and references that aren't a model or a string)\n\nHistorically, implementing these checks in validation.py would have meant extending the 'type specific' blocks in validation.py. Although these blocks already existed, it's not an especially good design pattern (putting all your validation logic in one place), so those three cases of localized validation have slipped in. \n\nI'm fairly certain that these checks could all be converted into system checks without any real change in behavior; and given that we're now moved to a 'check behavior stored on the field' archictecture, we can avoid the bad architecture. We also get slightly improved error reporting behavior as well -- under the current setup, if you have multiple ForeignKeys pointing to an abstract model, each one would be reported as an individual exception. Using a check-based approach, you'd get a summary of _all_ the bad references at once.\n\nAs for third party fields -- historically, they haven't had a choice. They've had to use assertions in `__init__`, because they didn't have access to validation.py. This is one of the reasons behind a move to a checking framework.\n\nSo - my advice for third parties (once this all lands in trunk) would be to use checks, rather than assertions in `__init__` checks -- and, for backwards compatibility, do both :-)\n\n@freakboy3742 Thanks for the clarification. That's good news - it's certainly nicer to do everything in system checks than it is to split the work with `__init__()`. \n\nI've rebased this branch. I've also improved documentation. I've also fixed the problem of compatibility checks -- I've added new `is_overridden` method to `Settings` and `UserSettingsHolder`. @ptone, do you have time to review documentation? This is the last thing we need to do in order to merge this branch.\n",
    "sumarized_length": 1294,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR introduces significant improvements by replacing the complicated `validation.py` logic; however, several key concerns have been raised. First, there's a substantive issue with skipping related field checks when values are strings, as it defers critical validation errors to runtime, risking user confusion and potential failures. Future implementation should ensure related fields are fully resolved before checks commence.\n\nTesting practices are also problematic; current reliance on string comparisons for error messages introduces brittleness. It’s suggested to explore alternatives akin to the `SuspiciousOperation` subclassing approach for better resilience against typographical errors.\n\nOpaque use of **kwargs for variable arguments is noted—while the intention to allow for future extensibility is valid, clear documentation or constraints would mitigate future architectural confusion.\n\nMoreover, documentation requires enhancement, particularly around coverage gaps that your diff analysis has highlighted, indicating untested lines need addressing. Finally, there's a proposal to clarify the distinction between initial validation in `__init__()` and more complex checks during model evaluation, advocating for system checks over concatenated assertions in third-party fields."

This is a little off-topic from this PR. Should I create a separate ticket for this? Or should we let it be for now?\r\n\nHey!\r\nI've made the changes suggested by @pope1ni.

Handling zero timeout. Redis-py does not support it natively and django expects to no set a key with zero timeout. I'm not sure at which level should this be handled. I was wondering if we perform the check in `get_backend_timeout` method and return a value (eg: None) or raise a suitable exception. \r\n\n> If `redis-py` isn't installed, or if Redis isn't running we get a couple of errors:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> django.core.cache.backends.base.InvalidCacheBackendError: Could not find backend 'django.core.cache.backends.redis.RedisCache': No module named 'redis'\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n\r\nShould I move the `import redis` line inside the `__init__` method of the RedisCache class? All memcache backend do that and the error raised when a binding is not installed is like this\r\n```\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pymemcache'\r\n```\r\nIncluding `import redis` at the top leads to an error message as you mentioned above.\r\nI wanted to move the import command like this\r\n```\r\nclass RedisCache(BaseCache):\r\n    def __init__(self, server, params):\r\n        import redis\r\n        super().__init__(params)\r\n        if isinstance(server, str):\r\n            self._servers = re.split('[;,]', server)\r\n        else:\r\n            self._servers = server\r\n\r\n        self._class = RedisCacheClient\r\n        self._options = params.get('OPTIONS') or {}\r\n```\r\nHowever, this would lead to some refactoring of code where `redis.ConnectionPool` etc are used.\r\nWhat do you think about this?\r\n\n> Should I move the `import redis` line inside the `__init__` method of the RedisCache class? All memcache backend do that and the error raised when a binding is not installed is like this\r\n\r\nYes, we should do something like this. Although with `pymemcache` it is done in `PyMemcacheCache.__init__()` because `pymemcache` provides the client class. We're writing the client class ourselves, so we want `import redis` in `RedisCacheClient.__init__()`.\nHey @pope1ni and @carltongibson \r\n\r\nAccording to the comments https://github.com/django/django/pull/14437#pullrequestreview-691776531, if we want to use the `redis.incr` or `redis.decr`, we would need to stop serializing the valus which are integers. I think this will create a mess as there would be too much to manual handling of values based on their types. As we are pickling the values, we can not directly use the `redis.incr` or `redis.decr` methods.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how useful it is to support milli-second timeouts. `django-redis` has migrated to an approach which supports both seconds and milliseconds ( [refs](https://github.com/jazzband/django-redis/pull/508/files) ). \r\n\r\nWe can make the logical databases configurable via the url as well as a parameter in the options. I'll work on it.\r\n\r\n\nWhile using the `from_url` method, we can not provide `username` and `password` in the `OPTIONS`. Even if we pass them in the kwargs, [kwargs.update(...)](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/redis/connection.html#ConnectionPool.from_url) overrides it with the `username` and `password` from the URL, else it sets it to None. One solution is that we only allow username and password to be set using the \"LOCATION\" key only. Let me know what you feel. @pope1ni @carltongibson \nThe master branch of redis-py has updated the implementation of the `from_url` method. \r\nhttps://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/blob/627db540acd1f1f36db88290d74cbcd75f6bda0c/redis/connection.py#L951-L955\r\n\r\nHowever, the latest stable branch (3.5.3) still uses the old implementation.\r\n```\r\nif decode_components:\r\n    username = unquote(url.username) if url.username else None\r\n    password = unquote(url.password) if url.password else None\r\n    path = unquote(url.path) if url.path else None\r\n    hostname = unquote(url.hostname) if url.hostname else None\r\nelse:\r\n    username = url.username or None\r\n    password = url.password or None\r\n    path = url.path\r\n    hostname = url.hostname\r\n\r\nif url.scheme == 'unix':\r\n    url_options.update({\r\n                'username': username,\r\n                'password': password,\r\n                'path': path,\r\n                'connection_class': UnixDomainSocketConnection,    \r\n})\r\n\r\nelif url.scheme in ('redis', 'rediss'):\r\n    url_options.update({\r\n                'host': hostname,\r\n                'port': int(url.port or 6379),\r\n                'username': username,\r\n                'password': password,\r\n            })\r\n...\r\nkwargs.update(url_options)\r\n```\r\nThis will always override the username and password in the kwargs. I think for now, we can only support giving the `username` and `password` via the url and once redis-py's latest implementation is stable, we can add supplying  `username` and `password` via the `OPTIONS`.\r\n\nHey @smithdc1! Thank you for the review.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I'm not so confident to comment on the main part with all the different options. I think my main observation there is about the structure, I find it a little hard to follow. There's many options here but here's one idea of how it could be structured.\r\n> \r\n> * Required settings\r\n> * settings which are available to all backends\r\n> * Redis specific items (optional)\r\n\r\nYes we could do that but that'll require restructing the whole documentation as there are some memcached specific items that are currently laid out in the examples section. In the future, I think such a restructuring would be nice where we can talk about cache specific arguements in a separate section.\r\n",

A similar failure occurred with SQLite, suggesting possible issues with the `my_cache_table` name conflicting with existing tables.\n\nAdditionally, updates were made to include handling of Redis configurations, specifically addressing the `zero timeout` challenge, as Redis-py doesn't support it. The suggestion to move the `import redis` statement to the `__init__` method was made to prevent import-related errors when the module is missing.\n\nArchitecturally, it was proposed to revisit how Redis authentication is handled, specifically concerning URL parameters versus `OPTIONS`. Future documentation restructuring could clarify required and optional settings across different backends."

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nWindowTestModel.objects.annotate(sum=Window(\r\n    expression=Sum('salary'),\r\n    order_by=ExtractYear('hiredate'),\r\n   frame=RowRange(start=-2, end=2)\r\n)).filter(sum__gt=100)\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould raise an exception.\n@charettes I didn't know. I'm trying to avoid touching core-classes of the ORM, but it appears that this is needed to guard against this type of query. At least, in `resolve_expression` of `Window`, the `query.where.children` is just a blank list. If you could provide a few pointers where to look, I'd be happy to have a go at this.\r\n\r\nAbout filtering, I have thought about extending it with a `FilterWindow`; MariaDB won't support this, so I guess it makes to just subclass `Window` and use a new template with `FILTER (WHERE condition)`.\n@charettes You may have some more input, e.g., `contains_aggregate = True` takes care of a lot of the same restrictions on the expression, however disallowing `DISTINCT ON` with PostgreSQL. Currently, it's false.\n@atombrella about the `contains_aggregate` issue. I think that introducing a new `contains_window = True` (or `contains_frame`, `contains_over_clause`?) flag (with a default nested lookup on `BaseExpression`) that the ORM can use to branch on is the way to go here. Window functions are new concept for the ORM so it's normal we have to deal with these expressions with special care just like we do with aggregates.\nSo before this should go through another round of review the problem of window expressions causing a GROUP BY to be added to the query needs to be addressed. I'm going to move the ticket back into patch needs improvement.\r\n\r\nAlso, Aggregates should not inherit from WindowFunc. Just add the window_compatible property to the base aggregate type. I noticed that some of the docs around the window_compatible property need to be cleaned up.\r\n\r\nOnce the GROUP BY issue is sorted I can give another review. Can you ping me here when that's done, and I'll make it a priority.\n@jarshwah I corrected a few things (changes are summarized in commit messages), including the docs around `window_compatible` and `filterable`. The `GROUP BY` should be sorted out (`contains_aggregate` is False, and `get_group_by_cols` is a blank list).\r\n\r\nI'm welcoming input for the tests, including test data (some values may not be chosen well).\nhttp://mysqlserverteam.com/mysql-8-0-2-introducing-window-functions/ <- I haven't considered this in the current patch (but it affects just the test annotations and the feature-flag). I think `window_compatible` should remain `True` for all aggregate functions, although support is limited to just a few of them on MySQL and MariaDB.\n@timgraham Would you have time to review docs soon? Thank you. I think the changes in `database-functions.txt` are mostly stand-alone. I made a bunch of improvements to the documentation today, and think it's approaching something that explains the concepts well (I don't know how much Django should cover in this regard since it's one of the more advanced features of SQL); I added some examples.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate a look at the tests, some of them may be covered by other parts of Django's test suite (there are a couple of questions in comments in there). Also, MySQL/MariaDB should probably be handled (this involves test annotations, and the feature flag). MySQL 8.0.2+ has a richer support for the functions than MariaDB. It doesn't seem like the MariaDB flag will be included in 2.0, so maybe it's better to scratch MariaDB notes from the code, and the documentation?\nI went through the feedback, but I still find the documentation tricky to get finalized (I fixed a few sloppy mistakes in the previous updates; it's squashed). Regarding examples, should I add sample data as well, or the description of what is enough? I think for some of those queries to make sense and fully\r\nillustrate what happens would require more than 4-5 rows (that's the number of in the aggregation section), making the document much longer. I use movies and books in three examples. The conditional aggregation document fully illustrates with a model, and some data, for comparison. All the documentation is now in already existing files.\r\n\r\nI believe all scenarios for the functions have tests, however there's a test, `test_two_functions` to check how two window expressions work. Perhaps it's redundant? There are some assertions to check the generated SQL, mainly for the frames-tests.",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR includes significant changes regarding window functions, but there are critical technical issues and implementation suggestions that require attention. \n\nFirstly, filtering on annotated window expressions must be disallowed to prevent potential exceptions. It's suggested that a check be added within `resolve_expression` of `Window` to raise an exception if `query.where.children` is empty. The proposal for extending with a `FilterWindow` is viable, yet MariaDB's limitations necessitate careful subclassing of `Window`. \n\nThe introduction of the `contains_window` flag is recommended to manage window functions distinctly, paralleling the existing `contains_aggregate` flag. The issue of window expressions causing unintended `GROUP BY` clauses must be addressed, with current flags indicating they are false and `get_group_by_cols` returning a blank list.\n\nReviewers should also note that aggregates should not inherit from `WindowFunc`, and instead, the `window_compatible` property should be applied to the base aggregate type. Documentation adjustments concerning `window_compatible` and test coverage are still needed. Ping for a review once the `GROUP BY` issue is resolved."

Django creates an intermediary join table in the db for every ManyToMany field. In theory, we could support db_comments on `ManyToManyFields` by putting those comments as **_table-level_** comments onto the intermediary join table that Django created. HOWEVER, we'd encounter a problem when the user specified a ManyToManyField with a `through` model, if they tried to put a db_comment on both the Field and also on the through model definition. I'm not 100% sure how to handle this. Either (1) Django supports db_comments on ManyToManyFields and adds them to the intermediary join table as a table-level comment _when there is NO `through` table_, but ignores the field-level comment _when there IS a `through` table_, or (2) Django never supports db_comments on ManyToManyFields at all (basically \"If you want a db comment on your M2M fields, you HAVE to use a through table and put the db_comment there\"). @KimSoungRyoul What do you think?\n**Test Cases:** \r\nThe test cases @KimSoungRyoul has now look good. I am trying to think of strange edge cases situations where covering with unit tests could be helpful. I'm not coming up with many. \r\n\r\n- ManyToManyField comments: As mentioned above, this special case might require separate unit tests.\r\n- Table-level comments on `through` models: Is there any difference for `through` models? I suppose not... Maybe unit tests on the `through` models is not needed?\r\n- What's the expected result if there is a comment in the db on a column and the Django user does NOT specify any comment  on the field? Django should make no change to the pre-existing comment, right?\nI did an additional review of the Django model docs and found three other situations where db_comment support might get complicated:\r\n\r\n### 1) Unmanaged models:\r\n([link to docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/options/#managed)). For any model that has...\r\n```python\r\nclass Meta:\r\n        managed = False\r\n```\r\n...Django will not perform create, modify, or delete operations on the model. That means that db_comments cannot be supported for unmanaged models. I recommend that the docs be updated to state that db_comments are ignored when managed = False. \r\n\r\n### 2) Proxy models:\r\n([link to docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#proxy-models)). A `proxy` model doesn't exist in the db in the same way as a regular model. So if a model has...\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Meta:\r\n        proxy = True\r\n```\r\n...then I think perhaps db_comments should not be supported at the table _or_ column-levels. That should be documented in the docs, should trigger a warning (during migration?), and should have a unit test to ensure that if a Django user specifies a db_comment on a proxy model that Django doesn't error.\r\n\r\n### 3) Abstract Base Classes:\r\n([link to docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/#abstract-base-classes)) Django doesn't create tables for Abstract Base Classes, so a table-level db_comment on an Abstract Base Class **_does NOT_** make sense. But a field-level (or \"column-level\") db_comment on an Abstract Base Class' fields _**DOES**_ make sense because those fields will eventually be created for any of the models that inherit from the Abstract Base Class.\r\n\r\nSo for example, with...\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\n\r\nclass CommonInfo(models.Model):\r\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\r\n    age = models.PositiveIntegerField(db_comment=\"User's age when they registered.\")\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        abstract = True\r\n\r\nclass Student(CommonInfo):\r\n    home_group = models.CharField(max_length=5)\r\n```\r\n...then a unit test should verify that in the db the `student` table has a column `age` with the comment \"`User's age when they registered.`\".\r\n\r\n\n> (👍 awesome work @KimSoungRyoul and great points @knyghty !)\r\n> \r\n> **ManyToManyFields:** This was a good catch by @knyghty. Django creates an intermediary join table in the db for every ManyToMany field. In theory, we could support db_comments on `ManyToManyFields` by putting those comments as **_table-level_** comments onto the intermediary join table that Django created. HOWEVER, we'd encounter a problem when the user specified a ManyToManyField with a `through` model, if they tried to put a db_comment on both the Field and also on the through model definition.

It's a relationship mapping between models.** \n> @KimSoungRyoul I was busy the past 2 weeks, but I have more control over my time for the coming 2 weeks.

    "summarized_comments": "This PR discussion highlights several key technical issues concerning the implementation of database comments during migrations in Django. One primary concern is the incompatibility of the new SQL grammar with existing test utilities like `assertTableExists()` and `assertColumnExists()`, which necessitates the creation of a new assertion utility, potentially `assertDBComment()`. The `DatabaseWrapper.introspection.get_table_description()` method needs modification to support testing of database comments, though its suitability for this purpose is questioned.\n\nThe conversation also stresses the need for system checks to handle cases where `db_comment` has no effect on `ManyToManyField`, with a proposed warning system. Architectural decisions were made regarding the handling of `db_comments` on `ManyToManyFields`, with a consensus leaning toward option (2): not supporting `db_comments` on such fields. Additionally, concerns were raised about unmanaged models, proxy models, and abstract base classes regarding how their associated comments should be documented and tested. New test cases and migration files were added to enhance coverage for edge cases identified, alongside revisions to existing utility functions and SQL definitions."

Regarding the `versionchanged` note, I actually don't know 😕. You know better than I do if this would be useful to most of django users or not.\n> Have you tested this on a Django project with lots of models? Is there a performance impact when a project has hundreds of models?\r\n\r\nI would not expect any performance impact as Django loads all models at startup anyway, before even loading the management command. This extension just fetches them from the app registry where they’re already referenced. Still worth testing with djangopackages to check everything works as expected.\nThank you @salvo-polizzi for progressing with this project 🎁 \r\n\r\nA couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- There's the [`--no-startup`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/django-admin/#cmdoption-shell-nostartup) option.

If I understand correctly, when I squash the latest 8 commits into one, the resulting commit message will be the first one, e.g., \"rebase on top of main branch.\" How can I retain the latest commit message instead of the first one? Do I need to reword both the first and the last commits so that the final message is \"Fixed ...\"?\r\n\r\nTotally fine, and sorry this is even a task that many with years of Git experience might struggle with. Follow the tutorial, but for the final commit, use `s` (`squash`) instead of `f`. Then, you’ll get your editor opened to merge the first and last commits’ messages as you wish. When you save and close your editor, the rebase will continue and you’ll have merged the message in.\r\n\r\nEdit: Or, yeah, you did what Sarah suggested, and that’s fine too!

At first all tests crashed with syntax errors when running against MySQL. This was because MySQL requires all expressions to be wrapped in parentheses while Postgres and SQLite allows not wrapping expressions if they are functions.  \r\n\r\nThis works on Postgres and SQLite but not on MySQL:\r\n`CREATE INDEX idx ON t1 (LOWER(col1) DESC);` \r\n\r\nMySQL requires the following (which Postgres and SQLite also supports)\r\n`CREATE INDEX idx ON t1 ((LOWER(col1)) DESC);`\r\n\r\nMaking the change to always wrap expressions in parentheses removed the required change in https://github.com/django/django/commit/3d64e9c919fc8c91ba2de2354fdad209fa3d796f to allow casted indexes for Postgres on `Cast.template`.\r\n\r\nHowever, adding this wrapping made expressions based on `OrderBy` throw syntax errors because the opclass / key_part is not seen as a part of the expression.  This would render to the following invalid SQL:\r\n`CREATE INDEX idx ON t1 ((LOWER(col1) DESC));`\r\n\r\nThis required a check to see if an expression is based on `OrderBy` (I added a convenience method on `BaseExpression` for this) and extract the ordering for appending at a later stage.  At the moment this change removes the possibility to add `NULLS LAST` and `NULLS FIRST` to column suffixes. This is not supported on MySQL and is not possible today with regular column indexes AFAIK. Maybe it’s okay to not support it initially? Adding support for these suffixes would require breaking out a lot of template-logic from `OrderBy`.\r\n\nJust realized that the current implementation messes up the index ordering. I’ll have to refactor the splitting of `Index.fields` into columns and expressions and instead keep them as a single unit.\nI think I have an external use case for simple_col, so I’m in favour of it in principle. \n> I think that the __init__ signature change to (*expressions, fields=(), ...) should be part of this PR.\r\n\r\nWe would need to make `*expressions` and `fields` mutually exclusive.

Should we raise an exception if both `*args` and `fields` are used?\nI this so, raising a `TypeError` to make sure both are exclusive seems like the most appropriate option.\nI've been looking into this a bit more and in my opinion we are at a bit of a crossway. We either allow `django.db.backends.base.schema.BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._create_index_sql` to be passed expressions in the `fields` argument or a new `expressions` argument.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/d6db186427d33889e4d2f3b56e02807d51fc0376/django/db/backends/base/schema.py#L959-L986\r\n\r\n`_create_index_sql` would now be responsible of compiling the expressions along with some new DSL-class, `Expressions`? [This method](https://github.com/django/django/pull/11929/files#diff-803276386305dab54c20b97d3d34b82fR64-R81) would be moved into the schema editor or a `Expressions` DSL-class. The main issue with the current `Columns` DSL-class is the quoting of columns which should not be done on expresssions as that’s already handled.\r\n\r\nThe other option is to pass the already compiled SQL into `_create_index_sql`, as is the implementation today, but then we have the issue of the `Columns` DSL-class not knowing if the column-string is a compiled expression or a column which needs quoting, thus the hack that @MarkusH highlighted in https://github.com/django/django/pull/11929#discussion_r414609238.\r\n\r\nI feel like the former approach is the correct one but it would touch a lot mode in the schema editor and DSL so I wanted to discuss this before starting any work.\r\n\r\n> I guess we could keep the fields kwarg around and automatically turn it into expressions = list(map(F, fields))\r\n\r\nI looked into this and it _should_ be fine if we make sure to never wrap `F` expressions in parens, we need to do the wrapping for all other expressions.\r\n\n@hannseman \r\n\r\nI think that allowing either `fields` or `expressions` to be passed to `_create_index_sql` and using the old mechanism when `fields` is provided is the way to go. Providing resolved expressions via `expressions` to `_create_index_sql` should remove the need for manual quoting since [`F` resolves to `Col` which handles its quoting itself](https://github.com/django/django/blob/9ef4a18dbe71f538a9ef8c39111ae2f0b62eb90b/django/db/models/expressions.py#L779-L783).\r\n\r\nI suspect a new DSL `Expression(Reference)` reference will be required to implement `references_` method [based on `get_source_expressions`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/9ef4a18dbe71f538a9ef8c39111ae2f0b62eb90b/django/db/models/sql/query.py#L1647-L1652) and `rename_column_references` to use a similar logic but use `set_source_expressions` to create renamed cols and assign them.\n@charettes thanks for the pointers and sorry for the late reply, lots of stuff going on at the moment. \r\n\r\nIf I understand this correctly we would need to pass an instance of `SQLCompiler` to `Expressions(Reference)`.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Expressions(Reference):\r\n    def __init__(self, table, expressions, compiler, quote_value):\r\n        self.table = table\r\n        self.expressions = expressions\r\n        self.compiler = compiler\r\n        self.quote_value = quote_value\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would initialise the compiler in `_create_index_sql` like:\r\n```python\r\ncompiler = self.connection.ops.compiler('SQLCompiler')(Query(model, alias_cols=False), self.connection, using)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving the compiler available in `Expressions` would allow us to utilise `compiler.query. _gen_cols` to get the `Col` instances for usage in the `references_` and `rename_` methods. \r\n\r\nWe could then use `self.compiler` in `Expressions.__str__` to get the SQL:\r\n```python\r\ndef __str__(self):\r\n    sql_expressions = []\r\n    for expression in self.expressions:\r\n        sql, params = self.compiler.compile(expression)\r\n        sql = '(%s)' % sql\r\n        params = tuple(map(self.quote_value, params))\r\n        sql_expressions.append(sql % params)\r\n    return ', '.join(sql_expressions)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? \n@hannseman sorry my late answer as well, looks it slipped through the cracks.\r\n\r\nI think your approach makes sense but could you elaborate on why passing already resolved and compiled expressions to `_create_index_sql(expressions)` wouldn't work? It looks like it would avoid passing a compiler object all the way down there.\n> @hannseman sorry my late answer as well, looks it slipped through the cracks.\r\n\r\n@charettes, no worries!\r\n\r\n> I think your approach makes sense but could you elaborate on why passing already resolved and compiled expressions to _create_index_sql(expressions) wouldn't work? It looks like it would avoid passing a compiler object all the way down there.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong here but if we want to pass actual `Expression`-instances by `_create_index_sql(expressions)` we would need a compiler to get the actual SQL string? If that wasn't the goal I misunderstood you.  \r\n\r\nPassing the compiled expressions to `_create_index_sql(expressions, col_suffixes)` with their eventual ordering in `col_suffixes` would be simple. But implementing the DSL `Expression(Reference)` methods `references_` and `rename_` would be a bit problematic since we only have the compiled SQL expressions, I guess we could do some regex/string replacement but that feels a bit sketchy.\r\n\r\nHaven't really touched this since we last spoke but here's a working proof-of-concept implementation of the new DSL class with the \"pass-the-compiler\"-approach, the \"only\" non-working part is `rename_column_references`, I got a bit lost on how to update the expression with the new column name:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Expressions(Reference):\r\n    def __init__(self, table, expressions, compiler, quote_value):\r\n        self.table = table\r\n        self.expressions = expressions\r\n        self.compiler = compiler\r\n        self.quote_value = quote_value\r\n\r\n    def references_table(self, table):\r\n        return self.table == table\r\n\r\n    def references_column(self, table, column):\r\n        columns = (col.target.column for col in self.compiler.query._gen_cols(self.expressions))\r\n        return self.table == table and column in columns\r\n\r\n    def rename_table_references(self, old_table, new_table):\r\n        if self.table == old_table:\r\n            self.table = new_table\r\n\r\n    def rename_column_references(self, table, old_column, new_column):\r\n        if self.table == table:\r\n            cols = self.compiler.query._gen_cols(self.expressions)\r\n            for index, col in enumerate(cols):\r\n                if col.target.column == old_column:\r\n                    # TODO: set_source_expressions somehow,\r\n                    # or can we mutable col.target.column?\r\n                    self.expressions[index] = col\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        sql_expressions = []\r\n        for expression in self.expressions:\r\n            expression = expression.resolve_expression(self.compiler.query)\r\n            ordering = ''\r\n            if expression.ordered:\r\n                ordering = ' DESC' if expression.descending else ' ASC'\r\n            sql, params = self.compiler.compile(expression.get_source_expressions()[0])\r\n            sql = '(%s)%s' % (sql, ordering)\r\n            params = tuple(map(self.quote_value, params))\r\n            sql_expressions.append(sql % params)\r\n        return ', '.join(sql_expressions)\r\n```\r\n\n> @hannseman Thanks 👍 I left few comments, also not all previous comments were addressed, e.g. #11929 (comment).\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments! I'll look into them. \r\n\r\nRegarding https://github.com/django/django/pull/11929#discussion_r414609238, this will no longer be relevant when passing actual expressions (as proposed by @charettes) to `_create_index_sql`. We can then handle it properly in the DSL-class.\n@atombrella thanks for your reminder! \r\n\r\n~~`pull-requests-windows/database=sqlite3,label=windows,python=Python38` seems to be failing with `django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such function: JSON_VALID` when creating the test database. Not sure if this is related to this PR but can't really find other CI-runs with this error.. I did add a test model with a `JSONField` but it feels weird for this to only fail on windows~~ It was a flaky test.\r\n\r\nI've been busy with personal and work stuff lately so I've haven't really had the time to give this PR the love it need. Things should be calming down now and my plan is to start addressing outstanding issues next week. \r\n\r\nI plan on starting with setting `supports_expression_indexes=False` as default and allowing expressions to be passed as `Index(*args)` instead of `Index(fields=[...]` plus addressing the comments made by @felixxm in July. After that I can introduce my proof-of-concept of introducing `Expressions` to `ddl_references`.\nI've pushed commits addressing most of the discussed issues:\r\n* `supports_expression_indexes` now defaults to `False`.\r\n* Expressions can now be passed as `*args` to `Index`.\r\n* Expressions are now compiled in the new `ddl_references` class `Expressions`\r\n* Removed the usage of warnings in `Index` in preference of system checks.\r\n\r\nI still have some questions about how `django.db.backends.ddl_references.Expressions` should be implemented to be fully compatible with the `Reference` API, maybe it'll be easier to reason about them when committed to this PR. @charettes I would love some feedback when you have the time. See: https://github.com/django/django/pull/11929/files#diff-5cbfd43e179d9afbeb80629b206c1b77R227\r\n\r\nThanks!\n@charettes @felixxm do you have any advice on how to try and push this PR forward? The 3.2 feature freeze is approaching fast and it would sure be nice to get everything in shape for an inclusion in that release.\r\n\r\nOne area that might warrant an extra eye is the validation of arguments `Index.__init__` which changed a bit with the addition of the `*expressions` arg. I'm also not sure about if we need to save the original arguments of `*expressions` for the `deconstruct()` or if we can use the current version:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/56644d8c1a873f6864429cf2c3661453a8d6e6c4/django/db/models/indexes.py#L63-L67\r\n\r\nThe whole new `Expressions` DDL-class also needs a needs a look through.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time!",
    "sumarized_length": 1344,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR discussion emphasizes the need for an enhanced Index API to support partial functional indexes and covering indexes, particularly for PostgreSQL and possibly MySQL. Key concerns include:\n\n1. **API Design**: The use of the `Index` API's `conditions` kwarg for partial functional indexes is confirmed, but clarity is needed for the implementation of covering indexes, leveraging the Postgres `INCLUDE` feature. It’s suggested that support should be focused within `django.contrib.postgres.indexes.Index`, as SQL Server isn't part of Django's core.\n\n2. **SQL Syntax Compatibility**: Differences in SQL syntax for expression indexes between Postgres and MySQL are noted. The need to standardize the wrapping of expressions in parentheses for MySQL compatibility presents challenges with existing index ordering, necessitating code refactoring.\n\n3. **Expression Handling**: There’s a push to allow both `fields` and `*expressions` while ensuring they are mutually exclusive to avoid ambiguity in composite indexes. Automatic conversion of string fields to `F()` expressions is proposed, with a suggestion to raise a `TypeError` if both are inadvertently used.\n\nOverall, the discussion reflects ongoing developments to refine the index handling within Django, with an emphasis on maintaining backward compatibility and extending functionality."

Here are my thoughts:\r\n\r\nCompiling the condition expression: I will further reflect on the possibility of pushing the condition expression lower in the execution stack. It's an interesting point that I wish to explore more.\r\n\r\nGeneralizing the condition expression: My approach did not involve specific hardcoding for F and Q. I have utilized Django's existing mechanisms, which, to my understanding, are already suited to handle these expressions in a general manner. If my understanding diverges from what you expect, I am open to clarifications.\r\n\r\nHandling EXCLUDED in PostgreSQL: My work is a continuation of PR [#13065](https://github.com/django/django/pull/13065) where EXCLUDED was incorporated.

If you think there are aspects I might have missed or misinterpreted regarding EXCLUDED, I am open to your guidance to ensure my contribution aligns perfectly with the project's expectations.\r\n\r\nI am still in a learning phase and appreciate your patience and guidance in this process.\nHello team @ngnpope, @felixxm, and @shangxiao 🙌,\r\n\r\nI'm ready for another review. 🚀\r\n\r\nI would like to bring to your attention the keyword EXCLUDED introduced in Django. I'm wondering if we should consider renaming EXCLUDED to avoid confusion with the EXCLUDED keyword specific to SQLite and PostgreSQL. From Django's perspective, EXCLUDED refers to the fields of new rows being inserted into the database, which implies using backend-specific keywords (like EXCLUDED, VALUES, NEW...). Hence, it seems necessary to clearly distinguish EXCLUDED in the Django context from EXCLUDED in the backend context.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Your insights and suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 😊👍\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and continued collaboration! 🌟\r\n\n> As a suggestion, you might want to reduce the scope of this PR to getting condition into bulk_create which supports F and Q expressions.

A primary concern is the need to support passing expressions to `where_clause` instead of relying on backend-specific SQL, as this poses SQL injection risks. The reviewer urges a general approach for condition expressions rather than hardcoding to `F` and `Q`, raising questions on where to compile these expressions and how to handle PostgreSQL's `EXCLUDED`, suggesting it might be beneficial to subclass `F`.\n\nAdditionally, there is a suggestion to narrowly focus this PR on integrating condition handling into `bulk_create`, deferring `EXCLUDED` support for future work due to MySQL's complexity with conditional updates. Lastly, the reviewer noted missed updates in release notes and documentation, alongside a reference to a previous discussion for creating the `Excluded` subclass.

It's a common problem that people have, and it feels like this patch should be able to deliver that. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuerySet().filtered_relation('relation', alias='alias_relation', condition=Q(), force_left=True)\r\nQuerySet().filtered_relation('relation', alias='alias_relation', condition=Q(), force_inner=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?\nAbout left joins, I think we should always generate the join as LEFT join. If the user wants to have INNER join, let's recommend doing `.filter(alias_relation__isnull=False)`. Now Django should be smart enough to turn that join to INNER join.\nThere are two cases where this needs additional tests.\r\n\r\nIf you do a filtered relation against a NOT NULL field, then the join should be generated as LEFT join instead of INNER join. Assume book.author is not nullable, then `Book.objects.filtered_relation('author', alias='only_young_authors', condition=Q('author__age__lte=20'))` should produce a query with LEFT JOIN for author.\r\n\r\nWe need to consider what should happen in split exclude cases:\r\n```\r\n qs1 = Author.objects.filtered_relation('friends', alias='young_friends', Q(friends__age__lte=20))\r\n qs2 = Author.objects.all()\r\n```\r\nnow, `qs1.exclude(young_friends__age__gte=10)` should produce a subquery like `qs2.exclude(friends__age__gte=10)` does for the filter clause. The test would be something along the lines of having one author with friends with ages 5 and 10 and 15, and another with friends of age 5 and 25 and 30.\n@holvianssi 0aac5d81a85f754719781bbb5f44dd01dff6c5d6 shows that you were right.\r\nexclude() was not supported at all.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned 2 use cases that are missing. I'm not sure I understood both, just one instead.\r\nplease can you clarify in view of latest commit ?\nThe other case can be seen with the following example data:\r\n   Book -> Author: age = 30\r\n\r\nWhere the model is something like Book.author = ForeignKey(Author, null=False)\r\n\r\nAnd the query is:\r\n```\r\nqs = Book.objects.filtered_relation(\r\n    'author', alias='young_authors', condition=Q(author__age__lte=20)\r\n)\r\nself.assertEqual(qs.filter(young_authors__isnull=True).count(), 1)\r\n```\r\nAs an additional performance improvement, if you do some other query against this relation, then the join type should be INNER. For example:\r\n```\r\n    self.assertIn('INNER JOIN' in str(qs.filter(young_authors__age__gte=10).query))\r\n```\r\nbut this case is not that important, it's just a performance optimization.\nThere is still another case to consider - should .filter(young_friends__age__lte=20).filter(young_friends__name__icontains='a') produce two joins, or reuse the same join (the question is if the query should match if there is a young friend with age less than 20 and 'a' in the name, or if it should match if there is a young friend with age less than 20, and a possibly separate young friend with 'a' in the name). If you query for .filter(friends__age__lte=20).filter(friends__name__icontains='a'), you'll get two joins with Django.\r\n\r\nThere are cases where it would be useful to be able to say \"add this join to the query, further .filter() or .exclude() operations will work against that exact join\", and there are cases where you want the current Django semantics for the added relation. So, I'm not sure which way would be the best one forward. If it would be possible it would be nice to have current Django semantics as default, but be able to say \"I want this join, I know what I'm doing\" as an option. But doing both might make this too complicated to work on.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes even some sense. We are getting into the dark areas of split_exclude(), join promotion and multiple joins for same reverse foreign key relation...\nI'm sorry this is getting so complex... I am a big advocate of doing something simple and then building on top of that.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the query semantics are hard to change. Doing so means breaking applications in subtle ways... Who's going to have test cases for all the different .exclude() and .filter(q1, q2) vs .filter(q1).filter(q2) weirdness?\r\n\r\nRight now I'm thinking that maybe we should go with a definition where .filtered_relation() essentially adds a single JOIN to the query no matter what. That is, we will not need split_exclude() support for this, nor do we have to implement .filter(q1).filter(q2) vs .filter(q1, q2) semantics. I believe this behaviour is what people will expect in any case. And, we can always add a flag to filtered_relation later on so that users can pick different semantics.\r\n\r\nIf we go with the above definition of \"single join per filtered_relation()\", then we'll need to verify the following items:\r\n   - We don't try to generate multiple joins in case of `.filter(young_friends__age__gte=10).filter(young_friends__name__icontains='a')`\r\n   - We don't try to split_exclude in case of `.exclude(young_friends__age__gte=10)`\r\n   - We correctly generate LEFT joins as explained in previous comments, and possibly also implement the INNER JOIN promotion performance optimisation.\r\n   - Documentation for the single join semantics.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice to support .select_related() and .prefetch_related() for .filtered_relation(), but let's leave that for later.\nI did a bit of work on top of this in https://github.com/django/django/pull/8238. There is a rebase + select_related support. If you feel like working on this still, please pick the work from the other PR and I'll close it.\r\n\r\nThis is starting to look like a really nice feature to me, nice work. And, we can forget about all of the complexities I mentioned in the couple of previous comments. If you can select_related to the filtered relation, and there is no need for the weird split exclude cases, I believe this will work much more intuitively for users.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it might be worth it to check if we could somehow deprecate the existing .filter().annotate() interactions, and instead ask users to use .filtered_relation().annotate(). This would remove a special case from the ORM. The special case is causing confusion both for users and for ORM developers,  so from my point of view that would be a nice cleanup.\n@jarshwah @atombrella Thank you both for your feeback. This is really appreciated, I do intend to address them, but first, I need to successfully rebase the PR.\r\nThe difficulty is unfortunately not just solving merge conflicts, but rather solving a design question that\r\nbfb746f983aa741afa3709794e70f1e0ab6040b5 brought since the last rebase of this PR, roughly 1 month ago.\r\nI will try to explain in few words what is my blocker.\r\nBefore bfb746f983aa741afa3709794e70f1e0ab6040b5 the select_related feature was implemented this way:\r\n```python\r\n# django/db/models/query.py\r\nsetattr(from_obj, self.cache_name, obj)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut after the new API introduced by bfb746f983aa741afa3709794e70f1e0ab6040b5 it became:\r\n```python\r\n# django/db/models/query.py\r\nself.field.set_cached_value(instance, value)\r\n```\r\n`select_related` feature is broken because the new implementation expect to have a descriptor field for every value selected by `select_related`.\r\n\r\nLet's take an example from the tests:\r\n```python\r\nqs = Author.objects.filtered_relation(\r\n            'book', 'book_join', condition=Q()\r\n        ).select_related(\r\n            'book_join__editor'\r\n        ).order_by('pk', 'book_join__pk')\r\n```\r\nFollowing this example, the new API expect to have a field on `Author` instance called `book_join`, which of course doesn't exists. So the test fails with `AttributeError` when we try to access `qs[0].book_join`.\r\n\r\nI will explore few ideas in order to solve the problem, but for the moment I'm wondering if it wouldn't be better instead, to leave `select_related` feature out of the scope of this PR, and come back later with another PR to bring it back. Once `filtered_relation` (or `filter_related`) is part of master.\r\nIt will be easier to tackle one challenge at a time.\nI did a rebase of the feature here: https://github.com/holvi/django/tree/filtered_relation\r\n\r\nFor the set_cached_value case I ended up just storing a setter in klass_info for both local and the remote object value setting. This seems to work well, and makes the code a bit cleaner than it was.\r\n\r\nI went through the queryset docs and checked how this works in combination with things you can do to a queryset. I ended up doing a small fix for .defer() queries. Note that some of the features aren't tested explicitly, and of course there's very little tests for combinations of the features.\r\n   - tested or no need to test separately: filter(), exclude(), get(), first(), last()\r\n   - values_list() tested, values() *not* tested\r\n   - annotate() tested\r\n   - order_by(), reverse() tested\r\n   - distinct() tested\r\n   - dates(), datetimes() - should be no need to test separately\r\n   - none(), all() - should be no need to test separately\r\n   - union(), interesection(), difference() *not* tested\r\n   - select_related() tested\r\n   - prefetch_related() *not working*\r\n   - extra() *not* tested, should work\r\n   - defer(), only() defer tested, only() should work\r\n   - select_for_update() not tested, should work\r\n\r\nThen there exists a bunch of data altering methods, of which I guess .update() together with F() to filtered relation might be worth a check.\r\n\r\nOf the above ones, I think we need something for prefetch_related() (IMO it's ok to document this doesn't work yet), and we should check union() type queries, and then still maybe add a test for values().\r\n\r\nAs for the API itself - I'll post to django-developers about that separately.",
    "sumarized_length": 1309,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR raises significant concerns about join type specification for `filtered_relation`, suggesting an implementation approach to allow users to force either `INNER` or `LEFT` joins with flags like `force_left=True` or `force_inner=True`. The current recommendation is to default to `LEFT` joins, while utilizing filters to achieve `INNER` joins when necessary. Several scenarios require further testing, particularly for inclusivity of NULL fields in joins and the behavior of split excludes.\n\nSpecific steps outlined include verifying join generation, ensuring accurate join types based on conditions, and the potential for performance optimizations when multiple queries utilize the same relation. A debate exists about whether to support multiple joins versus reusing the same join for chained filters. The suggestion to potentially deprecate `filter().annotate()` in favor of `filtered_relation().annotate()` highlights an effort to simplify ORM semantics, although the complexity of these changes poses risks of breaking existing applications. Additionally, the compatibility with `select_related` remains unresolved, delaying its inclusion in the current PR scope. Overall, the response emphasizes prioritizing clear and intuitive API behavior while navigating the intricacies of relational filtering."

Because we can decrease some duplicate code by using string constant in low-level function.\r\n\r\nI don' know it is a good way to doing like this or not.\r\nCould anyone give some advice?\nHi @ChihSeanHsu, great job! However, I think there is some room for improvement. \r\nWith `ignore_conflicts` it makes sense to just say \"ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING\" (on any conflict), but IMHO it is more complicated with upsert.\r\nThere is more than fields with `unique=True` that can produce the conflict. At least, there are `unique_together`, and actually, there can be any unique constraint added either via RunSQL or manual database change, and we don't know what exactly is going to conflict. Therefore, there is a need for a more granular API, which allows users to specify both `unique_fields` for the `ON CONFLICT` part and `update_fields`, similarly to `update_or_create`.\r\nWe are using [this library](https://django-manager-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/method-documentation.html#manager_utils.manager_utils.bulk_upsert), and in my experience, it does not seem possible to automatically infer the intended behavior (what to update on what fields conflict) and must be specified by the developer.\n@alextatarinov good point, we would need similar logic to what's used in `Model._get_unique_checks` to take `unique_together` and `UniqueConstraint` in account:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/10f8b82d195caa3745ba37d9424893763f89653e/django/db/models/base.py#L1037-L1045\r\n\r\nBut as you say it would probably make more sense to let the user specify the fields to conflict on.\nHi @alextatarinov and @hannseman,\r\n\r\nI have a question need to clarify, this new feature is based on `bulk_create` and it is based on `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY DO ...` or `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (...) DO ...`.\r\nConflicts will only happen when pk or unique keys duplicates, because it's a insert action.\r\nIMHO, we only need to let user input what fields(`update_fields`) they want to update, and I'll add more detailed in get `unique_fields`.\r\nOr do you two have any other concern?\r\n\r\nAnd upsert function in [this library](https://github.com/ambitioninc/django-manager-utils/tree/master) is not using this SQL command, it controls this action in application level not database.\nHello again, @ChihSeanHsu. If you specify `native=True`, the linked library uses the `ON CONFLICT` statement via the `querybuilder` library.\r\nI see where your logic goes, but I think there is a reason why the conflict target is required to provide when using `DO UPDATE` (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-insert.html#SQL-ON-CONFLICT). It means the database cannot automatically infer the conflict target, neither we can do it in Django. I am not sure why, one thing that comes to mind is that the row inserted can conflict with multiple other rows on different constraints, and the database won't know which row to update. Therefore, it's the developer who should specify unique fields that may lead to conflict + update. \r\nOn a side note, I think the inability to specify unique_fields for ignore_conflicts is also a shortcoming and should be addressed (maybe even in this ticket).\r\n\r\nP.S. I am nowhere an expert, so I suggest we ask someone more experienced.\r\nP.P.S.

I wonder if the API could be made a bit more flexible by modeling a bit more like `QuerySet.update()`?

Something similar to this:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE foo (\r\n    timestamp timestamp NOT NULL,\r\n    num_requests integer NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO\r\n    foo (timestamp, num_requests)\r\nVALUES\r\n    ('2020-12-21T12:00:00', 10)\r\nON CONFLICT\r\n    (timestamp)\r\nDO UPDATE SET\r\n    num_requests = foo.num_requests + EXCLUDE.num_requests;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfoos = [\r\n    Foo(timestamp=\"2020-12-21T12:00:00\", num_requests=F(\"num_requests\") + 10),\r\n]\r\nFoo.objects.bulk_create(foos, update_conflicts=True, update_fields=[\"num_requests\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure how portable that is though, or if it's mostly a PostgreSQL thing.",
    "sumarized_length": 1128,
    "summarized_comments": "In the PR comments, several technical concerns and suggestions were raised regarding the implementation of an \"upsert\" feature based on `bulk_create`. It was proposed that the argument for handling conflicts mimic `ForeignKey.on_delete` semantics, using `on_conflict = models.IGNORE | models.UPDATE`, to facilitate more complex updates in the future. It was agreed this change would be implemented. Furthermore, the `upsert_conflicts` argument was renamed to `update_conflicts`, simplifying the flags used.\n\nConcerns were voiced regarding the API's handling of unique constraints and the necessity for developers to specify both the `unique_fields` and `update_fields`. It was asserted that without explicit conflict targets in PostgreSQL, the database cannot infer conflicts, potentially leading to errors. This shortcoming also applies to the lack of unique field specification in `ignore_conflicts`. Suggestions to enhance flexibility included modeling after `QuerySet.update()` for operations beyond standard replacements, such as incrementing values on conflict. Additional unit tests were planned to cover these scenarios."

    "summarized_comments": "This PR includes significant updates and user feedback primarily focused on syntax tests and refactoring. Key modifications involved renaming `TemplateProxy` to `PartialTemplate` and relocating `SubDictionaryWrapper` to `utils.py`. However, discrepancies were identified in the template naming, causing `TemplateDoesNotExist` exceptions highlighted by user reports. A critical typo was corrected, yet issues persisted during manual tests.\n\nDebugging efforts revealed complex recursive exceptions, notably a recursion error when printing in the `get_exception_info` method. @FarhanAliRaza is urged to enhance realism in tests, particularly in `PartialTemplate.get_exception_info`, potentially replacing mocks for better accuracy.\n\nConcerns were raised about performance implications with regex usage, suggesting test cases involving larger templates to assess catastrophic failures. Additionally, discussions emerged regarding the template loading mechanism, hinting at possible adjustments to the `Engine.get_template` method for improved compatibility with partials. A collection of suggested tests aimed at edge cases in partial definitions and their error handling was also provided."

(`CASCADE` to `DB_CASCADE` on PostgreSQL 14) \n\nThe change in the field was correctly detected, the migration was generated, and when applied it reported success, but the constraint wasn't applied to the field. (No `ON DELETE ...` in the DDL.) \n\nThe test I'd like to see would hit the actual database. \n\nSomething like: \n\n1. Create a pair of models with `CASCADE`. \n2. Create some instances. \n3. Delete the parent model. \n4. Assert the children were deleted (by Django)\n5. Migrate the child model to use `DB_CASCADE`. \n6. Create some more instances. \n7. Delete the parent model again. \n8. Assert the children were deleted (by the database). \n\nIt's step 8 that failed for me (because the field was never updated). \n\nAs I say, I may have done something wrong.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comments identify two primary issues: a MySQL-specific error with the migration test `delete.tests.DatabaseLevelOnDeleteTests.test_foreign_key_db_default` and uncertainty around serializer testing. The MySQL error appears related to the inability to create the `DBDefaultsFK` table, likely due to a foreign key type mismatch. A suggestion is to investigate the generated SQL and potentially adjust the `on_delete` attribute from `models.DB_SET_DEFAULT` to `models.RESTRICT` to isolate the error's cause.\n\nAdditionally, for serializer testing, the reviewer recommends checking existing tests in `tests/migrations/test_writer.py` for guidance. The reviewer mentions that Django's handling of `on_delete=DB_SET_DEFAULT` might need reevaluation, given potential compatibility issues with MySQL's InnoDB storage engine. Lastly, there's a proposal to reorganize the use of `subTest`s for backward migration testing by associating multiple asserts under each `on_delete` option for clearer results."

What do you think? Are you sure we should leave it?\nwhere would be the fun if it didn't? :/\r\n\r\nI'll take a look tonight, but the error `cx_Oracle.DatabaseError: ORA-01036: illegal variable name/number` [according to this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21375288/ora-01036-illegal-variable-name-number-when-running-query-through-c-sharp) might not be easy to solve, apparently you can't use bind variables??\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to just raise a `NotSupportedError()` if I can't fix it?\r\n\r\nEdit: I also don't have a oracle system to test on, so this could be painful.\nSo I read a little more into how Oracle does things with [EXPLAIN PLAN](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14211/ex_plan.htm#i25909).\r\n\r\nI found out the following issues:\r\n\r\n- We need to change `explain_prefix` to `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR`.\r\n- AFAICT Oracle doesn't return the output directly - it goes into [PLAN_TABLE](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14211/ex_plan.htm#i17492).\r\n- A `PLAN_TABLE` is automatically created per user, but we won't know if it has been renamed.\r\n- Displaying the output is non-trivial - there are (provided) [scripts](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14211/ex_plan.htm#i16938) to do so.\r\n\r\nTo start you can change the prefix and see whether that get things moving further. Beyond that, I'm not sure whether we can auto-exec another query to fetch the output or whether we just have to somehow return a message/warning to explain how to get the output...\nDamn, that seems quite convoluted. Thanks for doing some research. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can use `SET STATEMENT_ID` with a GUID, then execute `SELECT PLAN_TABLE_OUTPUT FROM TABLE(DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY(NULL, [GUID]));`. Hopefully this comes back in postgres-style rows of strings that we can just join and return, but I couldn't see anything explicitly stating that with my brief look.\nI think I've managed to add support for explaining Oracle queries, but it is slightly hacky. Rather than significantly rework the implementation I opted to check if the vendor is `oracle` in the `explain_query` method, and if so ~~add in a random UUID~~ (UUID's are too long....) add a random string to the `explain_options` dict to give the plan a unique identifier.\r\n\r\nAfter we generate a query plan, it just returns the query you would need to execute to retrieve the plan. I'm not sure if we can execute this query inside the `explain_query` method itself (perhaps by using `connection.cursor`?). I've also got a test that actually does execute this statement to ensure it works, so lets hope it does.\nSo unfortunately it's not going to be possible to add support for Oracle to this feature. I've spent a while on it already and got something nearly working, but ran into a big roadblocker: You cannot use traditional SQL parameters with `EXPLAIN PLAN ...` in Oracle. For example, this fails:\r\n\r\n`cursor.execute('EXPLAIN PLAN SELECT * FROM something WHERE id = %s', [1])`\r\n\r\nYou should instead use an oracle specific (I think?) syntax:\r\n\r\n`cursor.execute('EXPLAIN PLAN SELECT * FROM something WHERE id = :id')`\r\n\r\nSo to support explaining queries with any kind of parameters we'd have to replace the parameters with `:NAME`, which I think is pretty impossible.\r\n\r\nSo, I've just disabled explaining queries on Oracle. My work on adding support still lives at https://github.com/orf/django/tree/28574-queryset-explain-oracle if any poor soul needs it in the future. I also defaulted the `supports_explaining_query_execution` feature to False, as I think third party backend support may be spotty.\nThank you for the review @timgraham, I've made the changes you've requested - they all made sense and I didn't want to reply to each and spam you. \r\n\r\nAfter splitting the tests out I found that they failed with the union queryset, it was actually doing entirely the wrong thing (executing the raw query without the explain prefix). I've fixed this and added a test case for `diff` as well, as well as actually testing that the explain prefix is in the executed SQL.\r\n\r\nThere is a missing space in the docs, I'll push a fix for that after the Oracle test suite passes.\nI found that something like this will silence the warnings: `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', '\\(1003, *', category=MySQLdb.Warning)`. Not sure if we want to add that in `runtests.py` or somewhere else. `category=MySQLdb.Warning` could also be omitted to avoid a try/except ImportError for if MySQL isn't installed.\nThanks @timgraham. I've added the warning filter to `runtests.py`, only if `MySQLdb` is installed. I figured that the warning would only be useful with MySQL tests and we wouldn't want to inadvertently filter out other warnings.",

The MySQL output is deemed less user-friendly and it has been suggested to modify it for better alignment with external databases, potentially requiring additional MySQL-specific logic in the `SQLCompiler.explain` method. \n\nThe Oracle integration faced significant hurdles: namely, the use of traditional SQL parameters is incompatible with `EXPLAIN PLAN`, necessitating a switch to named parameters (e.g., `:id` vs `?`). To manage Oracle’s unique output, a proposed change was to adapt the `explain_prefix` to `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR`. Further, it was identified that retrieving the output from `PLAN_TABLE` adds complexity, possibly requiring a warning message to inform users of additional steps needed. Ultimately, the conclusion was to disable this feature for Oracle due to constraints and complexities encountered, reflecting a deliberate architectural decision regarding support for various database backends. Additional minor fixes were also noted, including space corrections in documentation and warnings filter adjustments in `runtests.py`."

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comments raise several concrete technical issues regarding the use of the `oracledb` library in Django. Firstly, there is a dependency on Oracle Client libraries for tests in thick mode, and it's unclear if these are available in the `oragis19` test environment. The recommendation is to skip this specific test when using `thin` mode until future support is added. A dual testing approach is suggested: running tests for both `thin` and `thick` modes while using Jenkins workflows.\n\nThe primary concern is maintaining simplicity in workflows for Oracle, potentially standardizing on `thick` mode, which is seen as more limited. However, this contradicts the benefits of `thin` mode, which offers a lightweight solution without dependencies. Additionally, the test suite reported an increase in failures with the PR, primarily related to warnings from `django/db/backends/oracle/base.py`.

The whole world of `choices` stuff has grown additional use cases rather organically over the years and hopefully this will ensure that things are more robust and maintainable for the long term.\r\n\r\nGreat news! So just to clarify, is this ready for another review @ngnpope?\nThanks @nessita. I've made the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Fixed rebase conflicts :sweat_smile:\r\n- Removed the commits related to different approaches to avoid widget choices renormalisation - we can revisit this in a follow up if we think it something that needs looking into\r\n- Reordered cases in the match statement to move less common cases lower\r\n- Reworked a number of code comments for clarity, added more, rewrapped, etc.\r\n- Renamed `normalize_field_choices()` to `normalize_choices()` as it really normalizes choices for both fields and widgets.\r\n- Updated tests adding a few more assertions around callables/iterators\r\n\r\nI was then doing a little more thinking about the recursive case for normalising which is new. We probably want to limit how much we do that... After all, the nested case strictly speaking is only really designed around `<optgroup>` in HTML which doesn't support nesting of `<optgroup>`. I've added a fixup that guards on `depth < 2`, which solves this.\n> Thanks @nessita.

And I think it would be amazing if we can have this work landed before the feature freeze, so except security issues and releases, this is one of my top priorities to push forward.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, and while I'm very happy with the current state of `normalize_choices` and its tests, I do wonder if we could/should hide the `depth` param. My rationale is that `depth` carries a state(ish) that is internal/private to the normalizer and (IMHO) should not be leaked to the public API not used by any caller.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering, what would you think about including the following proposal?\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/django/utils/choices.py b/django/utils/choices.py\r\nindex 94c255c3e7..8addcb6219 100644\r\n--- a/django/utils/choices.py\r\n+++ b/django/utils/choices.py\r\n@@ -18,8 +18,7 @@ class CallableChoiceIterator(ChoiceIterator):\r\n         yield from normalize_choices(self.choices_func())\r\n \r\n \r\n-def normalize_choices(value, *, depth=0):\r\n-    \"\"\"Normalizes choices values consistently for fields and widgets.\"\"\"\r\n+def _normalize_choices(value, depth):\r\n \r\n     match value:\r\n         case ChoiceIterator() | Promise() | bytes() | str():\r\n@@ -54,10 +53,15 @@ def normalize_choices(value, *, depth=0):\r\n \r\n     try:\r\n         # Recursive call to convert any nested values to a list of 2-tuples.\r\n-        return [(k, normalize_choices(v, depth=depth + 1)) for k, v in value]\r\n+        return [(k, _normalize_choices(v, depth=depth + 1)) for k, v in value]\r\n     except (ValueError, TypeError):\r\n         # Return original value for the system check to raise if it has items\r\n         # that are not iterable or not 2-tuples:\r\n         # - TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable <type> object\r\n         # - ValueError: <not enough / too many> values to unpack\r\n         return value\r\n+\r\n+\r\n+def normalize_choices(value):\r\n+    \"\"\"Normalizes choices values consistently for fields and widgets.\"\"\"\r\n+    return _normalize_choices(value, depth=0)\r\n```\n> So I was wondering, what would you think about including the following proposal?\r\n\r\nWe could do this, but not sure it's necessary.

I can do this change if you are busy, let me know so we don't overlap when pushing :-)\nI've been doing extensive testing. Everything looks good except that:\r\n\r\n1. There is a behavior change such that: in `main` passing a callable for a model field `choices` triggers a check error:\r\n```\r\nERRORS:\r\nticket_31262.TestModel.field1: (fields.E004) 'choices' must be an iterable (e.g., a list or tuple).\r\n```\r\nbut with this branch there is no error. One would think this may be a good news and that we are solving [ticket #24561](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24561) along the way, but see below.\r\n\r\n2. When a given model field `choices` is a callable, running `makemigrations` on the unmodified model generates a new migration every time. This is because, as far as I have debugged, the migration autodetector code (in `generate_altered_fields` -> `deep_deconstruct`) would generate different representations of the field's choices for the `old_field` and `new_field`.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, suppose a model like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\n\r\ndef get_choices():\r\n    return ((i, i) for i in range(3))\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\r\n    field1 = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField(choices=get_choices, default=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe migrations autodetector builds these representations:\r\n```\r\nold_field_dec = ('django.db.models.PositiveSmallIntegerField', [], {'default': 1, 'choices': [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]})\r\nnew_field_dec = ('django.db.models.PositiveSmallIntegerField', [], {'default': 1, 'choices': <django.utils.choices.CallableChoiceIterator object at 0x7fbe18f53bd0>})\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and considering that I don't think it's wise to try to solve [ticket #24561](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24561) in this same PR, I think we should change `normalize_choices` so we keep consuming the callables as the code in `main` was doing (despite this being a sort-of step backwards).\r\n\r\nA naïve change is to remove the `case Callable() if depth == 0` that returns a `CallableChoiceIterator` but that has other implications. We need to think how to (at least for now) handle differently `choices` for model fields vs `choices` for forms `ChoiceField` (that does allow callables to be used).\r\n\r\n@ngnpope Do you have opinions? Ideas? (I will have to change my vote until we sort this out, just to match the current state of this PR landeability).\r\n\r\nI will also (try to) craft a test for the migration autodetector to catch this issue. @felixxm any ideas or suggestions are welcome!\nI think it's ok to consolidate this behaviour for normalizing choices as we have done to ensure consistency, but not do anything more to address full support for callables in model fields as per ticket-24561. Callable support (as well as incomplete) is undocumented so I don't think we need to worry too much. _(Sorry, but I can't dig more into this for a while.)_\nI agree with @ngnpope and @carltongibson that we shouldn't do anything else in this branch to address full support for callables in model fields.\r\n\r\nBut, I don't think that we can land this as is because the following items are, IMHO, regressions (despite callable support being undocumented for model field `choices`):\r\n\r\n1. In `main`, defining a callable for a `choices` param would result in a check error, and in this branch all checks pass.\r\n2. If someone defines `choices` in a field/model to be a callable (possible because of item 1), `makemigrations` generates a new migration for that field/model every single time is run (sort of like endless migrations for the field/model).\r\n\r\nI agree with Carlton in that we should go for the minimum viable to maintain the behavior on main while landing this work. In order to do that, and considering that I've narrowed the issue to be caused by the removals of:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        # in Field.__init__\r\n        if isinstance(choices, collections.abc.Iterator):\r\n            choices = list(choices)\r\n\r\n        # in Field.deconstruct\r\n            if name == \"choices\" and isinstance(value, collections.abc.Iterable):\r\n                value = list(value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: I have a newer (and better?) proposal in the comment next to this one :arrow_double_down: \r\n\r\nI'm proposing two things: PR #17167 to add a few more related tests in `main`, and a temporary expansion to `normalize_choices` so we can optionally unroll iterables for choices in model fields:\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py b/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\r\nindex fbbb6e59c7..9cc4d2fe2c 100644\r\n--- a/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\r\n+++ b/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\r\n@@ -545,7 +545,7 @@ class Field(RegisterLookupMixin):\r\n\r\n     @choices.setter\r\n     def choices(self, value):\r\n-        self._choices = normalize_choices(value)\r\n+        self._choices = normalize_choices(value, unroll=True)\r\n\r\n     @cached_property\r\n     def cached_col(self):\r\ndiff --git a/django/utils/choices.py b/django/utils/choices.py\r\nindex 7732bc3697..498c506be5 100644\r\n--- a/django/utils/choices.py\r\n+++ b/django/utils/choices.py\r\n@@ -18,7 +18,7 @@ class CallableChoiceIterator(ChoiceIterator):\r\n         yield from normalize_choices(self.choices_func())\r\n\r\n\r\n-def normalize_choices(value, *, depth=0):\r\n+def normalize_choices(value, *, depth=0, unroll=False):\r\n     \"\"\"Normalize choices values consistently for fields and widgets.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n     match value:\r\n@@ -44,11 +44,11 @@ def normalize_choices(value, *, depth=0):\r\n             # String-like types are iterable, so the guard above ensures that\r\n             # they're handled by the default case below.\r\n             pass\r\n+        case Callable() if unroll or depth == 1:\r\n+            value = value()\r\n         case Callable() if depth == 0:\r\n             # If at the top level, wrap callables to be evaluated lazily.\r\n             return CallableChoiceIterator(value)\r\n-        case Callable() if depth < 2:\r\n-            value = value()\r\n         case _:\r\n             return value\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe that the ultimate fix to avoid the unrolling of callable `choices` (and thus also fixing [ticket-24561](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24561)) is to have the migrations' autodetector and serializer to treat callable `choices` just like how callables for `default` are handled. Right now the main roadblock I found is that the [Serializer._registry](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/db/migrations/serializer.py#L354C9-L354C54) would match instances of `CallableChoiceIterator` against `Iterable` instead of treat them as functions/methods so they are serialized as `FunctionTypeSerializer`. I think we all agree this should be a separated PR.\r\n\n @ngnpope @carltongibson I've been thinking and trying different approaches to solve my latest concern (callable choices for model fields).\r\n\r\nToday I put together a solution (that I like better) which does not involve the **unrolling** of iterable/callable choices for model fields. Instead, I'm proposing changes to a field's `deconstruct` so we return the wrapped `func` from inside `CallableChoiceIterator` (when we have one). This way we avoid generating infinite migrations for callable `choices` (which brings us a step closer to solving the related ticket) with a solution that I humbly consider more \"correct\".\r\n\r\nI'm also ensuring that the model field's checks for callable choices are still being raised to be consistent with `main`, though these are easily removable if needed (for example, when someone works on [ticket-24561](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24561)).\r\n\r\nMy plan would be to, ideally, land this by the end of next week (feature freeze is approaching fast!). \r\nLet me know your thoughts!",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR addresses the normalization of field choices by updating `normalize_field_choices()` to `normalize_choices()`, enhancing maintainability and robustness through tests and comments. Key changes include fixed rebase conflicts, removal of redundant renormalization commits, and reordering case statements for efficiency. A significant concern raised is about callable field choices: currently, a callable for model field `choices` does not trigger a validation error, resulting in infinite migrations due to representation mismatches during `makemigrations`. There is a proposal to add an `unroll` parameter to the normalization function to handle iterables more appropriately without generating unnecessary migration files. Additionally, adjustments to the `deconstruct` method are suggested to return the wrapped function from `CallableChoiceIterator`. The proposed changes aim for consistency while tightening internal behavior, with a commitment to avoid any regressions and address the compatibility issues noted with ticket #24561 in a follow-up PR."

Then, by default, you test everything both ways, and you take care of the differences explicitly; whereas now, you're just assuming that what you didn't test specifically with sessions \"should work the same as with cookies\".\n\n(this is just a suggestion, I don't think it should be a condition for accepting this change)\n\nWith respect to your JS: One con of option 1is that it breaks if there's more than one form on the page, I think.\n\nEither of these two options seem like a workaround rather than a solution, though.

Using a different subclass that lives in `django.contrib.sessions` seems to be another valid option, especially to decouple core from contrib. @shaib What is your opinion on this?\n\n@raphaelm I think @apollo13 made an interesting suggestion, but there are problematic details. There are the decorators-from-middleware to take care of, and I think even the template tag calls the middleware's `get_token`. This, unless I'm missing something, means that the only way to avoid a setting would involve some mechanism where the active middleware registers itself upon instantiation; I'm not sure that kind of complication is justified, and it may be fragile as well.\n\nGood point, @shaib.

    "unsumarized_comments": "Nice patch Matthew! `EXISTS()` is the last remaining reason I had to use `RawSQL()`.\n\nI was wondering if it had been considered to allow passing a boolean to the `__exists` lookup instead of a queryset. I feel like `Author.objects.filter(books__exists=True)` is more intuitive than `Author.objects.filter(books__exists=Books.objects.all())`.\n\nBuilding on @charettes suggestion, I think maybe there should also be special-cased versions:\n\n```\n>>> Model.objects.filter(related__exists=True)\n>>> Model.objects.filter(related__exists=False)\n```\n\nOr should this collapse to a single case, where you can use `.exclude()` instead?\n\n> Or should this collapse to a single case, where you can use .exclude() instead?\n\nFWIW I really dislike exclude. I think Django could solve a lot of (internal) problems by ditching exclude and implementing everything in terms of filter (not that that can happen now, but no need to continue on that path).\n\nIf you choose to special case True, then do so for False also.\n\nSo `.exclude()` changes everything, and I'm not totally sure I understand how.\n\nI've managed to implement `.filter(related__exists=<boolean>)`, but none of the `.exclude()` stuff comes close: it appears to be doing an _extra_ subquery.\n\nHmm. Looking at the documentation, it may be possible to use the `EXISTS ()` query type automatically on a query when a queryset is provided on `relation__in`. Good idea?\n\nThe implementation of .exclude(cond) isn't anything more than .filter(~Q(cond)), and we definitely can't get rid of negated Q() objects.\n\nThere are multiple problems with the way negated filters are implemented currently in Django. I'll got a bit into why we have problems in this comment even if this PR might not be the right forum.\n\nFirst, the definition of a negated query is pretty much this: If obj in qs and obj not in qs.filter(cond), then obj in qs.filter(~Q(cond)).\n\nNow, this is pretty nice definition and we can make it work nicely, except for the case where we are filtering along a join generating multiple entries (aka a multivalued relation). Say, we have a book with three authors, aged 40, 50 and 60. If we do `qs.filter(authors__age__gte=50)`, we generate a query with a _join_ to authors, and filter to a set where the author's age is 50 or more. So, we actually have the _same_ book in the queryset _two times_. To implement the negated query `qs.filter(~Q(authors__age__gte=50))` we can't use a join. If we used a join and just negated the WHERE condition, we would filter out all rows for which the author's age is 50 or more, which leaves us one row for the book, that where the authors age is 40. This breaks the definition of negated querysets.\n\nThe correct way to write both the filter() and negated filter() query is to use a subquery. But, we can't use a subquery for the .filter() case, as `qs.filter(authors__age__gte=50).annotate(avg=Avg('authors__age'))` is defined to calculate the average age of the book's authors for those authors who are older than 50. If we used a subquery in the WHERE condition, we of course can't select the average from the subquery. For this reason, currently `qs.exclude(authors__age__gte=50).annotate(avg=Avg('authors__age'))` doesn't calculate the average over authors whose age is less than 50. We can't use both a subquery for .exclude() and an annotation for the same relation.\n\nExtra fun is generated because `qs.filter(authors__age__gte=50).filter(authors__height__gte=180)` is different from `qs.filter(authors__age__gte=50, authors__height__gte=180)`. The first one finds books where there is at least a single author older than 50 and taller than 180, the second one finds books where there is an author aged more than 50 and (possibly different) author taller than 180. That is, the first query uses a single join, the second one uses two joins. Again, due to implementation difficulties, negated filters do not actually work like this.\n\nSo, the tl;dr version of this is that we do have a problem with negated filters, but there isn't an easy fix in sight.\n\nThe fix might be that we change the definition of filter against a multivalued join to use a subquery (thus breaking .filter().annotate()), or that we change the definition of .filter(~Q(cond)) to not use a subquery (thus breaking the current definition of negated filtering). Both of these will break silently a lot of correctly written projects, so we need something else than just a release note for this. We could also try to fix the code, and I had some PRs a while ago trying to do exactly that, but making sure the code works for complex combinations of negated and non-negated filters over multiple multivalued relations and with annotations over the same relations is extremely hard.\n\nFor the specific problem in this PR with exclude, we should push the joins into the subquery. That is, instead of generating a query like\n\n```\nselect * from authors join friends on authors.id = friends.author1_id\nwhere exists (select 1 from authors where author.id = friends.author2_id)\n```\n\nthe query should be\n\n```\nselect * from authors where exists (\n    select 1 from authors a1\n        join friends on author1_id = a1.id where friends.author2_id = authors.id)\n```\n\nGiven models Book and Chapters(book=ForeignKey(Book)), I'd start with making sure the following queryset works: `Book.objects.annotate(last_chapter=SubQuery(Chapter.objects.filter(book=F('outerq__pk')).order_by('-chapter_no')[:1]))`\n\nBuilding on `F('outerq__')` will make it possible to automatically generate the where conditions like done in this patch. And, having the ability to connect the inner and outer query in arbitrary ways would be a handy feature in itself.\n\nHmmh, it might be we can't easily implement the F('outerq__') style of connecting subqueries to their parent queries. We'd need to resolve the F('outerq__') lazily as at the point the filter() method is called for the inner query, we don't yet have a reference to the outer query.\n\nAn idea is to add a Query.delayed_expressions list. When the inner query is connected to the outer query, we resolve all the delayed expressions, and similarly to how relabeled_clone is implemented, replace the delayed expression with a resolved expression.\n\nSo, for example, condition `filter(pk=F('outerq__publisher__pk'))` would  resolve to `Equal(Col(innerq.pk), F('outerq__publisher__pk'))`, and delayed_expressions would be `[F('outerq__publisher__pk')]`. When the inner query is connected to the outer query, we resolve delayed expressions, and get a map of `{F('outerq__publisher__pk'): Col('publisher.pk')}`. We replace all keys of the map with the value pointed by the map, very similarly to how relabeled_clone replaces aliases in the query.\n\nThis isn't exactly easy, but I believe it should work reliably.\n\nAfter starting to use `Exists()` and `SubQuery()` in a real context today, I think I agree. It's going to be much simpler if it's possible to refer to the outer queryset. For instance, I had a queryset that I needed to indicate if this was the first one (ordered according to a timestamp) for a given generically related object. This required a reference to a queryset of the same model, joined by both content-type and object-id.\n\nIn the end, I wound up writing it using `RawSQL`, because it just needed to be done. I'm not convinced it's easy/possible to do it without referring to the outer queryset using an `F(outerq__)`\n\nOkay, pretty happy with how this went tonight. I've managed to implement delayed `F()` expressions (although the delayed resolution only occurs in the `SubQuery` and `Exists` expressions at this point: maybe that's the only place it makes sense to though).\n\nIt makes the syntax for using these expressions slightly more cumbersome:\n\n```\nModel.objects.annotate(foo=Exists(Related.objects.filter(inner_field=F('outerq__outer_field'))))\n```\n\nHowever, this explicit nature is better, because it means that you can have an arbitrary relationship to the outer query (and potentially more than one), or indeed no relationship at all.\n\nI needed to not grab a `outer_query.table_alias()`, because for some reason that then caused the outer query's table to drop out of the FROM clause.\n\nApart from the `.exclude()` stuff, it's coming along pretty well. Really not sure how to start on that.\n\nHmm ok, so I'm seeing `self.subquery.query.sql_with_params()` return a (empty) tuple in my use case here. My Subquery has an aggregate in it, perhaps the bug is here: https://github.com/django/django/blob/92053acbb9160862c3e743a99ed8ccff8d4f8fd6/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L1224\n\nFor now I've fixed it locally by forcing `SubQuery` to return a list of params.\n\n> Great work! Can we add a NotExists() as well?\n\nIt might be more appropriate to define a `Not` expression and make `Exists.__invert__` return `Not(self.copy())` to provide `~Exists(..)`.\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment raises several specific technical issues regarding the implementation and behavior of the `EXISTS()` query and its interaction with negated filters in Django. It suggests allowing boolean inputs for the `__exists` lookup, making `Author.objects.filter(books__exists=True)` more intuitive than using a queryset. The commenter proposes special-casing both `True` and `False` for existence checks, suggesting that this could simplify usage.\n\nConcerns are expressed regarding the current implementation of `.exclude()`, which generates extra subqueries, compromising the integrity of negated queries, particularly in multivalued relations. The current approach leads to incorrect results when aggregating data and can silently break existing implementations if changes are made. The proposal includes restructuring queries to push joins into subqueries and exploring the potential of using `F('outerq__')` to connect inner and outer queries effectively.\n\nIt concludes with a recommendation to explore a `NotExists()` expression or a `Not` class for negated conditions, enhancing query flexibility without compromising existing functionality."

I got codegen in principle working in [this commit](https://github.com/rtpg/django/commit/c4ac6ecb434bf6861fdbddf4860a36a0970a8087). The point here is that I can annotate an `async` function, run a `libcst`-based script on it, and it will generate a non-`async` version of that function (tailored to our needs and preserving things like comments).\r\n\r\nEven with just a 180 line script I have comments preservation, `if TYPING`-level functionality, and it's fairly straightforward. Haven't done async generators yet but it should be quite easy.\r\n\r\nAnd the very important thing here: the codegen'd sync versions (so far) _are generating exactly the same code_ that is in the repo already (modulo a decorator). This means that we can introduce async implementations, _write code as if those are the canonical implementations_, but the sync versions are still fast. \r\n\r\nThis was surprisingly easy, will start a discussion over in the forums on this later this week\n> ... I got codegen in principle working in [this commit](https://github.com/rtpg/django/commit/c4ac6ecb434bf6861fdbddf4860a36a0970a8087). The point here is that I can annotate an `async` function, run a `libcst`-based script on it, and it will generate a non-`async` version of that function (tailored to our needs and preserving things like comments).\r\n\r\nOk, you're proposing to do something similar to what psycopg 3 already did (see \"[Automatic async to sync code conversion](https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2024/09/23/async-to-sync/)\") but you propose to use [LibCST](https://libcst.readthedocs.io)?\r\n\r\n> ... will start a discussion over in the forums on this later this week\r\n\r\nPlease do it, it will be interesting.\r\n\r\nActually, I was thinking something similar after reading the psycopg's article, but I don't have the time to do it :-(\nOK the thing going on here was much more straightforward: `BaseConnectionHandler` (The handler for `connections`) uses an `asgiref.local.Local` to hold onto its connections. When we go into a task, the context changes (-> we lose access to the cached conection). Within the async context, we end up building a second `connection`.\r\n\r\nSo in my case, I build a connection in the top-level sync context, call `sync_to_async` (going into an async context), and end up building a second connection (Because the top-level sync context's connection is not visible to me).\r\n\r\nMight need to think a bout about how `ConnectionHandler` should work in this world. For `psycopg3`, `AsyncConnection` _is_ thread safe so we _can_ share between threads here (EDIT: but probably still want to open fresh connections!)\r\n\r\nThis is reinforcing my feeling that we should make sync-ness a backend property (rather than a connection property), and in that case `connections` could do the right thing. But I am not sure that is everything.\nThe main reason I went for \"hybrid\" backend is that we could run migrations with sync connections, and we won't have to touch the migration framework.\r\n\r\nIf understand correctly the issue: once you're inside an `async_to_sync`, you're in a different thread, and from inside that thread there's no visibility of pre-existing connections created by `ConnectionHandler`\r\n\r\nI see that `ConnectionHandler` [is marked as `thread_critical = True`](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/db/utils.py#L145). This causes the `asgiref.Local` variable holding the connections to be thread_critical as well, which means it will use `threading.local()` as storage, rather than `contextvars.ContextVar`.\r\n\r\nIf we set `ConnectionHandler.thread_critical` to `False`, the async thread can see the connection. But I'm pretty sure that's a bad idea.\r\n\r\nCould we set a contextvar that just says \"there's an active sync connection\" upon sync connection creation, have `new_connection` check for it, and then instruct the user on what to do? (ie: \"Please close your active connection first\")\n> If understand correctly the issue: once you're inside an async_to_sync, you're in a different thread, and from inside that thread there's no visibility of pre-existing connections created by ConnectionHandler\r\n\r\nRight, though I _believe_ that if you go do `async_to_sync`, then in there go `sync_to_async`, you'll actually recover your sync thread context due to `asgiref.Local`.\r\n\r\nBeyond thread-safety, there's the reality that each connection is its own universe. So if we share a connection between many tasks, it'll be sharing transaction state etc. I think that _sometimes that's what we want_, but... generally that's probably not what we want.\r\n\r\nFor my specific issue the reality was probably just that I should set a statement timeout during tests for deadlocks. In practice I think timeouts would catch these kinds of deadlocks otherwise. Just wish we could get a deadlock error to show up.\r\n\r\n> The main reason I went for \"hybrid\" backend is that we could run migrations with sync connections, and we won't have to touch the migration framework.\r\n\r\nMy idea here was more that a backend would _only_ open `Connection` or `AsyncConnection`, but the sync and async APIs would still work. In practice what it would mean is that sync migrations would be going through `async_to_sync` a bunch if you have `\"ASYNC\": True` set up for your backend. And inversely async code would work like it currently does if you're `\"ASYNC\": False`. But given that multi-connections is what we're expecting to do in general.... I don't believe in this idea as much.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's \"totally fine\" for a sync connection to be open while you're doing async stuff. If the sync connection is inside a transaction it feels very likely that you might mess something up, so that might be an easy restriction to put in place, though.\nOne gnarly idea I had while sleeping on this idea (at least for postgres): for a given backend, when I open a new connection with `async with new_connection():, I assign it a unique ID (`CUID`).  Then I check for any existing connections higher up the stack in a given context, and I do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# on the new connection\r\nSELECT pg_advisory_lock(CUID);\r\n# on any other existing connections that are currently open within the new connection's context\r\n# (shared so that we don't accidentally linearize all the existing connections)\r\nSELECT pg_advisory_lock_shared(CUID);\r\n```\r\n\r\n^ the point with the above would be to indicate to postgres that the existing connections won't progress until the new connection is completed. So if the new connection ends up trying to access a resource that is dependent on existing connections' transactions or whatnot will properly trigger deadlock detection.\r\n\r\nI don't think we need to deal with this in this PR. Beyond this being PG-only, it's not 100% clear to me that this is right, nor how to implement it cleanly.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGenerally I'm just worried about rolling out this API and then realizing that it's super easy to deadlock your system without DBs being able to detect that. Timeouts handle issues in prod _somewhat_ but the timeout message might not be very clear (and how do we distinguish that from \"normal\" timeouts?) \r\n\r\nHanging tests are tough.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: on my branch I ended up, in tests, adding a connection setup signal and just doing `SET statement_timeout to 10000;` there. Good enough to avoid infinite hanging)\n@fcurella @carltongibson \r\n\r\nHey 👋\r\n\r\nI’ve prepared a small POC where I tried to separate the database wrappers for the sync and async variants.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to explore an alternative to the current approach, where both sync and async methods are duplicated inside a single class (e.g., using acommit alongside commit). While the current solution works, I feel it makes the code harder to follow. Splitting it into two separate implementations introduces some duplication, but keeps the interface cleaner and easier to understand.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a moment, please take a look and share your thoughts:\r\n\r\n🔗 https://github.com/Arfey/django/pull/1/files\r\n\r\nThanks 😌\r\n\r\nps: @fcurella [It](https://github.com/Arfey/django/blob/70e40cc15ee9fe2b76ca3bccae089d648ed10713/django/db/backends/base/base.py#L1388-L1390) can be interesting for u 😀\r\n\r\n\n> @Arfey I think more duplication is acceptable IF we write in a such a way that we can use codegen to maintain it. @rtpg can you look at @Arfey 's code and see if codegen could work with that?\r\n\r\nI've thought about the code generation described in this [article](https://www.psycopg.org/articles/2024/09/23/async-to-sync/), and we already have a [script](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg/blob/9bde1475f0e77beaf285d72f97c9ead721e8cd94/tools/async_to_sync.py#L144) that will work well for us. It's easy peasy. Just replace async and await with an empty string.\r\n\r\nBut we have some consequences:\r\n\r\n- We need to write async code first and generate sync code from it\r\n- We need to have a mirror implementation for sync and asynchronous versions\r\n\r\nIn our case in sync class we have a lot of code which we need to make migration, introspection and etc, and I've deleted it.\r\n\r\nalso i dont understand how to deal with \"not simple\" async code like [that](https://github.com/Arfey/django/blob/70e40cc15ee9fe2b76ca3bccae089d648ed10713/django/db/backends/base/base.py#L1388-L1390), or async.gather \r\n\r\nThat's why I've decided to prepare a version with full duplication (to avoid changing the existing sync code). As u can see, we don't have a lot of duplication if compared with the current MR.\r\n\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment highlights several concrete technical issues and suggestions regarding the implementation of async-to-sync code generation within Django's database backends. The initial code generation approach, leveraging `libcst`, successfully produces sync alternatives to annotated async functions, preserving code structure such as comments. However, there are concerns about the `ConnectionHandler` class where context-local connection visibility may lead to redundant connections upon switching contexts with `async_to_sync`. \n\nTo address this, a proposal to adjust `ConnectionHandler.thread_critical` to `False` was mentioned; however, this raises potential risks. An alternative is suggested: implementing a context variable to monitor active connections and inform users on connection states. \n\nMoreover, establishing unique connection identifiers and utilizing PostgreSQL's advisory locks to manage transaction states could mitigate deadlock risks, although further evaluation of these ideas is necessary before implementation. Clarity in separating sync and async methods in the database wrappers is also encouraged to enhance maintainability, despite the inherent duplication of code."

I have the three phases broken out into unique commits and have added some of the documentation and copied the tests from the postgres module into a new class that should run against all of the database backends.\r\n\r\nI ran into two issues in the process that I wanted to get your opinion on.\r\n\r\n1. Python is compiled against Sqlite3 version 3.37.0, which doesn't have support for the order by yet. So the ordering tests aren't running for that. I think I would need to compile Python from source and point it to a specific version of Sqlite3 to get past this, but I'm not sure if you have any thoughts.\r\n2. Sqlite3 doesn't behave well when you combine `distinct` and a delimiter value. It throws an error of `SQLite doesn't support DISTINCT on aggregate functions accepting multiple arguments.` So it treats the delimiter as a second argument. In Sqlite if you don't provide a delimiter it will use a comma as a default. I was trying to build it such that if the user sets the delimiter to a comma and is using Sqlite as a backend, then the delimiter is ignored. However, I could figure out how to make that work. I tried a few things around custom SQL, using a class attribute instead of making it part of `expressions`, etc. but I couldn't quite get it right. If you can see a good way to treat that, I think it would be awesome to make distinct work in Sqlite for at least some scenarios, if not all.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I named it `StringAgg` because that is what I am used to, and it feels like the more descriptive function name between that a `GROUP_CONCAT`, but I'm open to changing that to whatever you think is best. I guess would could always have an alias class `class GroupConcat(StringAgg): pass` if we really wanted to make it smooth for developers from either environment, but that doesn't seem to pass the smell test on \"one way to do something\"\r\n\nHello @camuthig, thanks for spinning this up!\r\n\r\n> Python is compiled against Sqlite3 version 3.37.0, which doesn't have support for the order by yet.

I think I would need to compile Python from source and point it to a specific version of Sqlite3 to get past this, but I'm not sure if you have any thoughts.\r\n\r\nIt's possible CI might not be be setup here but if you're a *nix setup [you can use `LD_PRELOAD` to point at any SQLite version](https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/ld-preload#user-content-building-the-library). You don't have to build from source as [the SQLite project provides pre-built binaries](https://sqlite.org/download.html).\r\n\r\n> Sqlite3 doesn't behave well when you combine distinct and a delimiter value.

In such cases, duplicate elements are filtered before being passed into the aggregate function. For example, the function \"count(distinct X)\" will return the number of distinct values of column X instead of the total number of non-null values in column X. \r\n\r\nUsually when we run into these edge cases we [add a database feature](https://github.com/django/django/blob/dfd63ff43408e7901cc214b0482a7f844244d439/django/db/backends/base/features.py#L5) (e.g. `supports_aggregate_distinct_multiple_argument`) and use for two purpose.\r\n\r\n1. Adjust `Aggregate.as_sql` to raise an error when `self.distinct and not connection.features.supports_aggregate_distinct_multiple_argument and len(super().get_expressions()) > 1`\r\n2. Add tests for `@skipUnlessDBFeature(\"supports_aggregate_distinct_multiple_argument\")` that cover the backends that support it and `@skipIfDBFeature` that makes sure the proper exception is raised.\r\n\r\n> As a side note, I named it StringAgg because that is what I am used to, and it feels like the more descriptive function name between that a GROUP_CONCAT, but I'm open to changing that to whatever you think is best. \r\n\r\nI think `StringAgg` is fine as that's the name most backends use (Postgres, SQLite, SQLServer)\n@charettes I think I have updates for all of your comments at this phase. I was able to build a custom python environment with pyenv and brew using guidance [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/333#issuecomment-234707676) and test the group concat and ordering behaviors with a more recent version of sqlite, so that is cool.\r\n\r\nI know there are some conflicts and I can work on cleaning those up. I'm also not totally sure what is wrong with the docs. I ran the same command on my own machine, and everything seems to build properly.\n@charettes I have update the code to hit all of your comments and get the linters passing. I will take a dive into the failing tests shortly. At least some of them appear to be because we have moved the `connection.features.supports_aggregate_filter_clause` into the `AggregateFilter.as_sql` function, but have historically allowed for this check to fail and convert it to a `WHEN` statement. Now, though, when converting to the `WHEN`, we are throwing the `NotSupportedError` again. If you have thoughts on how you would like to see that flow, I'm open to suggestions.\n> At least some of them appear to be because we have moved the connection.features.supports_aggregate_filter_clause into the AggregateFilter.as_sql function, but have historically allowed for this check to fail and convert it to a WHEN statement.

It works great. \r\n\r\nI spent time digging into the other failures in MySQL and determined that the MySQL implementation of `GROUP_CONCAT` doesn't actually play nicely with any of the other engine implementations. I have some code together that passed the aggregate tests on both MySQL and Postgres locally, but it is certainly messy and probably brittle.\r\n\r\nFirst, it allows for multiple expressions, which we can ignore for now. The bigger issues are that MySQL doesn't support filtering on aggregates and it uses a different format order between the delimiter and ordering.\r\n\r\nSqlite: `GROUP_CONCAT(expression, delimiter ORDER BY order_by)`\r\nMySQL: `GROUP_CONCAT(expressions* ORDER BY order_by SEPARATOR delimiter)`\r\n\r\nSo here, if you want to introduce a delimiter you MUST have a different template, which is solvable. The bigger issue is that the order matters between `ORDER BY` and `SEPARATOR`: `SEPARATOR delimiter ORDER BY order_by` is invalid syntax. This required me to manually build the parameters in `as_sql` and force the order of things to get the parameters into the right order depending on the engine.\r\n\r\nThis was further compounded by the fact MySQL doesn't support aggregate filtering and we are forcing a `CASE` statement. So if you have `filter`, `order_by`, and `delimiter` you need a third ordering of parameters, with the filter parameters coming before even the expressions. 😞 \r\n\r\nDo you think there are some level of feature flags we can throw on MySQL to make this easier? Or maybe allow for engine-specific default separators to be ignored in our queries? I have a commit with some experimentation here: https://github.com/django/django/pull/18361/commits/cbe50126aa80ca8b5d79c48578aca1d29a673288\n> I have a commit with some experimentation here: https://github.com/django/django/commit/cbe50126aa80ca8b5d79c48578aca1d29a673288\r\n\r\nThanks for pushing a commit demonstrating the scope of the problem.\r\n\r\nLooking at it my immediate reaction would be to avoid over complicating `StringAgg.as_sql` and favor encapsulating the logic entirely in `as_mysql` instead. In there you'll know that the `FILTER` clause is not usable and will likely be able to simplify things quite a bit from some local testing locally.\r\n\r\n> Or maybe allow for engine-specific default

Swapped the JSON test behaviors to a new, JSON specific model to avoid adverse effects on other tests.\r\n2. Changed up how I dealt with MySQL to make it a bit more simple, and generally focused on just MySQL.\r\n\r\nI haven't had a chance to set up the Oracle VM, so I don't know that the tests are going to pass on that backend. Can we run it again, and if issues continue, then I will get that VM configured.\r\n\r\nI kept the MySQL changes as a separate commit to make them easier to review at this phase: https://github.com/django/django/pull/18361/commits/43415289e723fbcb7fc772f4c17718f7b72d30e1 .

I really appreciate your help on that one, I wasn't going to be able to triage that one quickly.\r\n\r\nRegarding the `test_string_agg_filter_in_subquery` the challenge here is that Oracle is treating these case clauses differently than, for example, MySQL. MySQL is treating those values as `None` and we are getting the same results for MySQL as PostgreSQL. Oracle appears to be casting `null` to a string and getting `''` instead. I'm good with blocking the filter behavior for any backends that don't support filter natively. I think that check would be pretty straightforward to add in there and would cover MySQL and Oracle. \n> Oracle appears to be casting null to a string and getting '' instead. \r\n\r\n@camuthig the reason for this is this is that [for Oracle](https://github.com/django/django/blob/f4813211e2d8017b56b7447f56ad17df3fae9aa3/django/db/backends/oracle/features.py#L16) `NULL` and `\"\"` (empty string) are the same thing which means that it doesn't provide facilities to differentiate between the two (it can't).\r\n\r\nThinking more about it I think that in order to account for that we should make the following adjustments\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/tests/aggregation/tests.py b/tests/aggregation/tests.py\r\nindex a23ae47487..fd535b1867 100644\r\n--- a/tests/aggregation/tests.py\r\n+++ b/tests/aggregation/tests.py\r\n@@ -2323,7 +2323,7 @@ def test_string_agg_filter_in_subquery(self):\r\n             \"Paul Bissex;Wesley J.

    "sumarized_length": 1663,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment highlights several critical issues and suggestions regarding the implementation of database aggregation functionality. \n\n1. **SQLite and Ordering Tests:** The current SQLite version in Python (3.37.0) lacks support for the `ORDER BY` clause, affecting test execution. It is recommended to utilize `LD_PRELOAD` for dynamic library loading to overcome this without recompiling Python from scratch. \n\n2. **DISTINCT and Delimiter Handling in SQLite:** The implementation encounters errors when using `DISTINCT` alongside a specified delimiter. It is suggested to apply a feature flag for databases, such as `supports_aggregate_distinct_multiple_argument`, to manage this behavior gracefully via the `Aggregate.as_sql` method, raising errors or skipping tests accordingly.\n\n3. **MySQL Implementation Complexity:** The differing syntax for `GROUP_CONCAT` in MySQL complicates the logic in `as_sql`. It’s advised to centralize the logic specific to MySQL to simplify handling expressions, delimiters, and filters, while ensuring that any MySQL-specific quirks are accounted for to prevent brittle implementations.\n\n4. **Oracle Error Management:** Oracle syntax peculiarities necessitate conditionally handling filters that result in `NULL` or empty strings due to type casting. It's crucial to incorporate database feature flags to maintain integrity in test assertions, as indicated by the proposed changes to account for the behavior of empty strings versus `NULL`. \n\n5. **StringAgg vs. GROUP_CONCAT Naming:** The naming convention of `StringAgg` appears aligned with other backends; however, the option to create an alias for `GROUP_CONCAT` is open for"

I'm now working on a failing case - when i run makemigrations again after migrations of moving model are generated, a new migration for altering model options for moved model is generated. If I pass `managed=False` along with `db_table` in moved model in new app, no new migration is generated.\nOn SQLite, tables with relations to a moved model are rebuild (we should add a test to check performed queries and fix this), e.g.\r\n```bash\r\n$ python manage.py sqlmigrate test_one 0003\r\nBEGIN;\r\n--\r\n-- Alter field field_fk on myrelatedmodels\r\n--\r\nCREATE TABLE \"new__test_one_myrelatedmodels\" (\"id\" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, \"field_fk_id\" bigint NULL REFERENCES \"test_one_mymodel\" (\"id\") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED);\r\nINSERT INTO \"new__test_one_myrelatedmodels\" (\"id\", \"field_fk_id\") SELECT \"id\", \"field_fk_id\" FROM \"test_one_myrelatedmodels\";\r\nDROP TABLE \"test_one_myrelatedmodels\";\r\nALTER TABLE \"new__test_one_myrelatedmodels\" RENAME TO \"test_one_myrelatedmodels\";\r\nCREATE INDEX \"test_one_myrelatedmodels_field_fk_id_2e7a4f46\" ON \"test_one_myrelatedmodels\" (\"field_fk_id\");\r\n--\r\n-- Alter field field_m2m on myrelatedmodels\r\n--\r\n-- (no-op)\r\n--\r\n-- Delete model mymodel\r\n--\r\n-- (no-op)\r\nCOMMIT;\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n$ python manage.py sqlmigrate test_two 0002\r\nBEGIN;\r\n--\r\n-- Create model MyModel\r\n--\r\n-- (no-op)\r\n--\r\n-- Alter field field_fk on myothermodel\r\n--\r\nCREATE TABLE \"new__test_two_myothermodel\" (\"id\" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, \"field_fk_id\" bigint NULL REFERENCES \"test_one_mymodel\" (\"id\") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED);\r\nINSERT INTO \"new__test_two_myothermodel\" (\"id\", \"field_fk_id\") SELECT \"id\", \"field_fk_id\" FROM \"test_two_myothermodel\";\r\nDROP TABLE \"test_two_myothermodel\";\r\nALTER TABLE \"new__test_two_myothermodel\" RENAME TO \"test_two_myothermodel\";\r\nCREATE INDEX \"test_two_myothermodel_field_fk_id_d5d44589\" ON \"test_two_myothermodel\" (\"field_fk_id\");\r\nCOMMIT;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, please fix `schema.tests.SchemaTests.test_m2m_through_remove` and remove all example apps from migrations tests (they should be replaced with a autodetector/schema tests, where appropriate).\n> On SQLite, tables with relations to a moved model are rebuild (we should add a test to check performed queries and fix this), \r\n\r\nIts because in `field_fk` ,`null=True` was added when the model was moved to other app in your project.

Model `C` has fk to `A` and `B`, and `B` has m2m field to `A` through `C`. We move model `B` to `app_two` first and then move model `C` to `app_two`. For moving model C we have to change the `through` of model `B` to `test_two.C` and hence it should have an `AlterField` operation which is missing. \r\n\r\nIf we only move Model `C` to `app_two` and not `B` , `AlterField` is added for the m2m field as through is changed. \r\nWill update the PR as soon as it is solved.\n@shaib Thankyou for reviewing! I'll push the suggested changes shortly.\r\n\r\n>If this has other advantages over the use of SeparateDatabaseAndState, then it may be justified, however, as the code stands -- if I understand correctly -- the added model is left unmanaged in the end (that is, take model A from app first to app second, and now -- in the migrations -- second.A is unmanaged).

We don't want the model to be unmanaged.

I don't think it's worth exemplifying the initial implementation to pre-existing special case unmanaged models. When it's the case the operation that Django currently generate on main are just fine; DeleteModel and CreateModel are database noop for unmanaged models (it's the approach used to move managed models here)\r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying, I had a small doubt in this case but now its clear.\r\n\r\n>2. I think the initial implementation should support moving models without a Meta.db_table override (by issuing a RenameModel). The Meta.db_table override should only be a way for users to avoid the rename not a forced opt-in mechanism into moving models auto-detection.\r\n\r\nIf I understood you correctly , we should have `AlterModelTable` to rename the mode table instead of `RenameModel`, right?\nThanks @charettes !\r\n>1. The moved-to un-managed model creation migration (the first one) should depend on the moved-from optional rename + marking model unmanaged migration (the first one)\r\n\r\nI wonder if it is really required ? 🤔 because un-managed model creation migration running before optional rename + marking model unmanaged migration shouldn't cause any trouble .\r\nIf we make un-managed model creation migration dependent on optional rename + marking model unmanaged migration, they will combine to have one migration and then migrations will run like:\r\n\r\n`AlterModelTable`+`AlterModelOptions` in `old_app`  -->  `CreateModel` unmanaged in `new_app`  -->  `AlterFields` (if any) + `DeleteModel`  in `old_app`  -->  `AlterModelOptions`+`AlterField` (if any) in `new_app`\r\n\r\nTotal 4 migration files.\n> I wonder if it is really required ? 🤔 because un-managed model creation migration running before optional rename + marking model unmanaged migration shouldn't cause any trouble .\r\n\r\nI believe it is at least as otherwise any usage of the un-managed models in the _moved-to_ application will crash if the _moved-from_ managed model table doesn't exist or has the wrong table name.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that there's no way to guarantee that a migration runs immediately after another, any other migration with similar requirement could be interleaved and try to use the _moved-to_ unmanaged models so we must ensure that models are always in a usable state at migrations boundaries.\r\n\nun-managed model creation migration can't depend on the optional rename + marking model unmanaged migration both. If we did so, the next migrations will be optimized and the model will be created as managed(due to `AlterModelOptions` optimization) --> and then `DeleteModel` in `old_app` . \r\n\r\nAnd if we modify the code to run `AlterFields` (if any) + `DeleteModel` in `old_app` --> `AlterModelOptions` + `AlterField` (if any) in `new_app` after  un-managed model creation migration, then Altering m2m field in last migration in new app will give error since old from model is deleted. 🤕\r\n\r\nBut it might work if un-managed model creation migration depends only on the optional rename migration and rest remains the same. 🤔 \nWas able to do a simple case on SQLite and it moved very well 🥳 experience felt magical\r\n\r\nI think I have found an issue when moving on SQLite in the multitable inheritance case.\r\n\r\n### Starting point \r\nMigrations applied and all tables have some data\r\n<details><summary>app1/models.py</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Base(models.Model):\r\n    data = models.TextField(default=\"Example\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ExtendBase(Base):\r\n    field_data = models.TextField(default=\"Field data\")\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Moving\r\n<details><summary>app1/models.py</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\nfrom app2.models import Base\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ExtendBase(Base):\r\n    field_data = models.TextField(default=\"Field data\")\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>app2/models.py</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.db import models\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Base(models.Model):\r\n    data = models.TextField(default=\"Example\")\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI run: `python manage.py makemigrations`\r\n<details><summary>console</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\nWas the model app1.Base moved to app2.Base?

And when `AlterField` operation is reloading the `extendbase` model after updating, its seeing it as another one to one field with same name as `base_ptr`. Even after we solve this issue by comparing `app_label` along with base pointer name [here](https://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/db/models/base.py#L290), it will still throw `InvalidBasesError` error because base is still pointing to `app1.base` but new base is `app2.base`.\r\n\r\nThere are two simple doc solutions for this (keeping the complications in mind) :\r\n1. Either we can document to not move a model which is being inherited by another model.\r\n2. Or we can document if someone want to move a base model inherited by other models, they'll have to move all the models inheriting that base model along with base model (like moving `base` and `extendbase` together in above case).\r\n\r\nOne complicated solution can be to create a new operation `AlterModelBase` and change the base of model inheriting another model while moving it (not sure of the implementation part yet).\r\n\r\nCCing @charettes to know his views on this.\n@DevilsAutumn I have found something else around [Django's contenttypes framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/contenttypes/) that needs investigating and a proposed solution\r\n\r\nRoughly the issue is that ContentTypes stores the app_label and model name of all models. This looks a bit like this:\r\n```\r\n>>> from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType\r\n>>> ContentType.objects.values()\r\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'app_label': 'admin', 'model': 'logentry'}, {'id': 2, 'app_label': 'auth', 'model': 'permission'}, {'id': 3, 'app_label': 'auth', 'model': 'group'}, {'id': 4, 'app_label': 'auth', 'model': 'user'}, {'id': 5, 'app_label': 'contenttypes', 'model': 'contenttype'}, {'id': 6, 'app_label': 'sessions', 'model': 'session'}, {'id': 7, 'app_label': 'sites', 'model': 'site'}, {'id': 8, 'app_label': 'flatpages', 'model': 'flatpage'},{'id': 9, 'app_label': 'app1', 'model': 'mysimplemodel'}, {'id': 10, 'app_label': 'app1', 'model': 'taggeditem'}]>\r\n```\r\nWhen I move `MySimpleModel` from app1 to app2, makemigrations and migrate, instead of the `ContentType` instance `{'id': 9, 'app_label': 'app1', 'model': 'mysimplemodel'}` being updated to `{'id': 9, 'app_label': 'app2', 'model': 'mysimplemodel'}`, a new instance is created `{'id': 11, 'app_label': 'app2', 'model': 'mysimplemodel'}`.\r\nThis means any `GenericForiegnKey` using `MySimpleModel` breaks as they still expect it to be in app1 (as the FK is pointing at the old one).\r\n<details><summary>error if useful</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> TaggedItem.objects.get(id=1)\r\n<TaggedItem: test>\r\n>>> test = TaggedItem.objects.get(id=1)\r\n>>> test.content_object\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<console>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"\\django-move-model-between-apps\\venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\django\\contrib\\contenttypes\\fields.py\", line 261, in __get__\r\n    rel_obj = ct.get_object_for_this_type(\r\n              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"\\django-move-model-between-apps\\venv\\Lib\\site-packages\\django\\contrib\\contenttypes\\models.py\", line 184, in get_object_for_this_type\r\n    return self.model_class()._base_manager.using(using).get(**kwargs)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_base_manager'\r\n```\r\nI am using the model that is [used in the docs example](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/contrib/contenttypes/#generic-relations)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI think this needs a test and a fix 🤔 ",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR indicates that additional tests in `tests/migrations/test_operations` are necessary to ensure data integrity during migration operations involving model movements, particularly in `test_move_model_with_fk`. The suggestion includes creating subtasks for better organization and clarity within tests. The author has replaced the `state_only_op` flag with subclasses `CreateModelInAppState` and `DeleteModelInAppState`, enhancing code readability.\n\nA significant issue identified involves a loss of dependency records during the model alteration sequence, which can cause migration errors. It was observed that SQLite rebuilds tables linked to moved models, while MySQL only alters them, leading to inconsistencies. The author is working on ensuring the `DeleteModel` operation does not interfere with ongoing model alterations.\n\nAdditionally, there are concerns regarding ContentType entries not updating correctly upon model moves, which breaks any `GenericForeignKey` references. The proposal includes documentations about model inheritance during moves and introducing an `AlterModelBase` operation for better handling of related models during migrations. Further testing is advised for scenarios involving multiple table inheritance."

It's essential to implement a more robust matching approach.\n\n4. **Text Formatting**: The conversion of HTML to a format user-friendly for Manim is recommended. Users should be able to upload any file type to `assets/codes`, which the application would process automatically.\n\n5. **Space Character Handling**: There are concerns regarding space characters in text processing, particularly impacting the `t2c` function. A proposed solution involves an enhanced method (`apply_space_char`) to manage spaces intelligently.\n\n6. **PR Structure**: There's a debate on consolidating changes into one PR versus creating multiple.

It might be better to print a warning that certain defaults are used, which points the user to where they can go to set their own defaults for where files are output, etc.\r\n\r\nI re-added the global default configuration `manimlib/default_config.yml`.\r\nNow it will only warn that the default configuration is being used when it is run for the first time, and give the path to change it.\r\nAt the same time, if one accidentally delete the default configuration in manimlib/, he will enter the configuration guide during runtime.\r\n\r\nBut there is another issue here. In Windows, if `temporary_storage` is not set and the system default temporary folder is used, `OSError` will be thrown:\r\n```\r\nOSError: C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Tex\\cf5d7f9f2e57398a.svg not Found\r\n```\nWhen I run it right now with the manimgl command, there seems to be an issue in initializing the Window.  I can try to look into it, but do you have any sense of what might have affected Window?\r\n\r\nIt works fine for file writing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/py39/bin/manimgl\", line 10, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(main())\r\n  File \"/Users/grant/cs/manim/manimlib/__main__.py\", line 14, in main\r\n    scenes = manimlib.extract_scene.main(config)\r\n  File \"/Users/grant/cs/manim/manimlib/extract_scene.py\", line 112, in main\r\n    return [BlankScene(**scene_config)]\r\n  File \"/Users/grant/cs/manim/manimlib/scene/scene.py\", line 47, in __init__\r\n    self.window = Window(self, **self.window_config)\r\n  File \"/Users/grant/cs/manim/manimlib/window.py\", line 18, in __init__\r\n    super().__init__(**kwargs)\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/moderngl_window/context/pyglet/window.py\", line 51, in __init__\r\n    self._window = PygletWrapper(\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyglet/window/__init__.py\", line 648, in __init__\r\n    self._create()\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyglet/window/cocoa/__init__.py\", line 197, in _create\r\n    self.context.attach(self.canvas)\r\n  File \"/opt/anaconda3/envs/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pyglet/gl/cocoa.py\", line 299, in attach\r\n    self._nscontext.setView_(canvas.nsview)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'setView_'\r\n```\nBut there is no problem running manimgl on my computer.

If that's the problem then move the import statement in `TextBox` `on_key_press` method since, the PygletWindowKeys is only used there.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef on_key_press(self, mob, event_data):\r\n        from pyglet.window import key as PygletWindowKeys\r\n        symbol = event_data[\"symbol\"]\r\n        modifiers = event_data[\"modifiers\"]\r\n        char = chr(symbol)\r\n        ...\r\n```\nIt's also solved by calling \"from manimlib.window import *\" above that line.\r\n\r\nThis seems like it's exposing a deeper problem, though, which I'll look into.\nAm also struggling with the OpenGL problem.  No apparent resolution in sight.   \r\n\r\nRunning Mac OS Big Sur 11.2.3 and I see that:\r\n(i) Mac OS deprecated OpenGL some time ago and the Big Sur upgrade appears to have broken several packages (including manim)\r\n(ii) [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63475461/unable-to-import-opengl-gl-in-python-on-macos) StackExchange thread appears to be a great resolution for many people but the many great suggestions provided by contributors but hasn't worked for me.\r\n\r\nI gather that not only is OpenGL a deprecated library, but also the Python-native routines to find libraries are also undergoing revisions in an effort to do better at finding binaries to prevent these kinds of problems.\r\n\r\nSo... I've been >>stuck in a ditch<< for days trying to do what should be a simple install.  Sigh....\r\n\r\nHelp I think I could use:\r\n(A) How do I run a linux \"find\" command that will precisely identify the specific location of the the OpenGL library?  I have, for instance, clearly eliminated the possibility that /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/OpenGL is the path I need; since that file (after many attempts at installation) just does not exist on my system.   Could be that I have it....but so far all I can find is >>directories<< named OpenGL (not libraries.)\r\n\r\n(B) What command can I run that will guarantee the download, installation, and report-of-location of the OpenGL library?  It'd be great if there was some easy way to easily install a fresh OpenGL lib based on Apple's new \"Metal\" API; but I have failed to find an easy way to do this.\r\n\r\nYour help would be appreciated!  :)\r\n\r\nBTW -- me and my son just LOVE the vids and graphics from the 3b1b team!   Stay strong you fine people!\r\n\n> \r\n\r\nI had this problem on Python 3.8 but changing to 3.9 solved the issue. Worth a try for anyone who is on 3.8 and get `OpenGL missing` issue on Mac.",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR suggests moving `manimlib/imports.py` into `manimlib/__init__.py` to enable wildcard imports, but maintaining current imports raises concerns about best practices. The inclusion of non-manim libraries in the default import should be avoided to enhance explicitness. Only manim-related imports should remain. Regarding configuration, defaults should be established for first-time users to improve UX, with a warning indicating where custom configurations can be set. A recent issue arose with temporary storage on Windows, leading to an `OSError` when default paths were used. A workaround included removing specific import lines to address a problematic OpenGL context that caused errors with Window initialization. This highlights a deeper issue with import order affecting operational success. It’s recommended to isolate and refactor imports in specific methods to avoid such conflicts while continuing to investigate OpenGL compatibility across OS environments."

It’s critical to evaluate the API responses for consistency, especially in the parameter formats across the various jobs (d2l-zh/PR-581/3 to d2l-zh/PR-581/21). There is a concern regarding the error handling mechanism, which needs to incorporate better logging practices for easier debugging. Additionally, security implications were noted around data validation; it’s essential to implement stricter validation checks to prevent XSS attacks in user-input fields. The architectural components should also be assessed for optimal scalability; consider leveraging asynchronous processing for extensive job executions to enhance performance. Lastly, ensure that the CI/CD pipeline is properly configured to run automated tests on each job completion, enhancing reliability in deployment."

    "unsumarized_comments": "Hey Phil!\r\n\r\nI know my views are different than many on this topic, but the main (only?) reason I would use an asynchronous server over a synchronous one is to achieve much higher scaling. This solution obviously does not address this problem, so this should be noted. I think the note about the performance is warranted, but just a partial aspect, the scaling limitations should be noted as well.\r\n\r\nA second thought is that it would be nicer if multiple async view functions could run concurrently in the asyncio thread, all under the same loop. I believe your implementation would allow only one async function to run at any given time. It seems there wouldn't be any problem in using a shared loop to run all of them concurrently, and that would eliminate some of the performance penalties in using this solution, I think.\nI'd prefer to avoid a v2 branch, and wait till next year and the end of Py2 before merging this. (Edit: Forget to say why). As I don't think it is worth maintaining a v2 branch as it couldn't be released.\r\n\r\nI've looked into asgiref, I'm not sure it is a good fit here - will take another look though, thanks.\nSaw @miguelgrinberg tweet about using an async SQLAlchemy demo: https://twitter.com/miguelgrinberg/status/1279894131976921088, might be relevant to consider with this. Here's the greenlet to async gist: https://gist.github.com/zzzeek/6287e28054d3baddc07fa21a7227904e\n@davidism So it's still somewhat early to call victory on this, but if you want some details on what I have done...\r\n\r\nWhat Mike Bayer's gist made me realize is that you can do greenlet context switches within an asyncio task, and this allows us to interrupt standard functions and send control back to the asyncio loop. To test this out I added a [custom hub](https://eventlet.net/doc/hubs.html) class to eventlet that does all the waiting using asyncio primitives such as asyncio.add_reader, add_writer, etc.\r\n\r\nSince Flask runs great with greenlets, I can now run Flask on top of eventlet, which runs on top of asyncio! Here is some of the crazy things I've tested:\r\n\r\n- await for an async function in a normal Flask view function (without blocking, obviously):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/foo')\r\ndef foo():\r\n    await_(asyncio.sleep(1))\r\n    return 'Hello!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `await_` helper function uses `asyncio.create_task()` to launch the passed coroutine as a normal asyncio function, and then uses a greenlet based event to wait for it to complete w/o blocking.\r\n\r\n- use an async function as a Flask view function by decorating it with the same `await_` helper:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/foo')\r\n@await_\r\nasync def foo():\r\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\r\n    return 'Hello!'\r\n```\r\n\r\n- await a non-blocking standard function inside an async function. Here is requests.get() with eventlet monkey-patching:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@app.route('/baz')\r\n@await_\r\nasync def baz():\r\n    rv = await make_awaitable(requests.get, 'https://google.com')\r\n    print(rv)\r\n    return 'Hello!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `make_awaitable()` helper function starts a greenlet on the requested function and waits for it to complete using a `asyncio.Future`.\r\n\r\nNone of this is Flask specific, actually. In fact I haven't had to hack on any official packages, this is all running on official Flask, greenlet and eventlet packages.\r\n\r\nWhat I love about this solution is that all of this works on a single OS thread, without executor tricks. It's truly an asyncio application that just has some \"under the table\" context switches done via `greenlet.switch()`. And the eventlet monkey-patching allows blocking functions in the Python standard library to run on top of asyncio and become awaitables.\r\n\r\nI hope I will have something that people can test and poke holes at soon.\n@miguelgrinberg thanks. I think this PR is the right direction still as it allows the same functionality with any WSGI server rather than the Eventlet WSGI server, or the monkey-patched Werzeug dev server. Thereby allowing users to simply add async routes, rather than change their server. Would you agree?\r\n\r\nAlso note that Quart allows the same as what you are describing without greenlets, using [this](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart/-/blob/master/src/quart/flask_patch/_patch.py#L37) or [nested asyncio](https://github.com/erdewit/nest_asyncio). Another option could be to copy the Quart code into Flask and add an ASGI interface to the Flask-app. \n> I'm not a fan of this approach, since it does not give you scalability\r\n\r\nI think we have differing aims as my aim is to have the ability to write async/await code in Flask as I'm not sure any proposed solution makes Flask more scalable than it is at the moment.\r\n\r\n> If you want to handle 1000 concurrent requests you need to allocate for 1000 threads or processes or a combination of them.\r\n\r\nI don't think this should be the case, it was my understanding that asgiref played nicely with gevent/eventlet (with one thread created by asgiref) - testing at the moment suggests it is unstable under race conditions. I think this can be fixed and asgiref running within a gevent patched world is feasible.\r\n\r\n> but there are really a lot of options, including gunicorn, waitress, maybe even meinheld.\r\n\r\nIs this by starting an event loop and then running gunicorn (etc) within it? Or is there an easier solution I'm missing?\r\n\r\n> How would you use the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension with Quart to talk to a MySQL db? \r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly if an `await_` can be defined and used then these solutions are possible. In Quart (with the flask patch system) an `await_` is,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef await_(coro):\r\n    return loop.sync_wait(coro)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've created an ASGI interface for Flask [here](https://github.com/pgjones/flask/commit/0338f37e3c3c6186cb1a12ad4308ad58b964fcb7) if it helps testing things.\r\n\r\n> Would that be enough to support the user choosing either solution? \r\n\r\nI think it is possible to support either but I think if we answer, \"should Flask's async/await support be conditional on the server that runs it?\" we would have a preference. My view at the moment is that Flask should support async/await without requiring any changes elsewhere (e.g. server), as I think Django is doing.\n@davidism I agree that it does not prevent another solution. I think an extension, or otherwise, could [override the Flask class `ensure_sync`](https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/3412/files#diff-412713dfdbad4d0754cb3693b36a4232R44).\nAgreed. The `ensure_async` wrapper is fine. Other implementations can intercept the async function with a decorator before it reaches Flask, or override the wrapper in a `Flask` subclass.\r\n\r\n> I think we have differing aims as my aim is to have the ability to write async/await code in Flask\r\n\r\nYes, I understand. I worry that a lot of people will mistakenly think this is actually a full integration and will be disappointed/file bugs when they find the limitations. I think our differences go back to what Mike Bayer was saying the other day. Python has two parallel universes now, the sync one and the async one, and they only communicate through weird mechanisms such as executors and the like. You seem to be happy with this so you look at best options within these rules. I'm extremely unhappy about this situation and would love to change it.\r\n\r\n> I don't think this should be the case, it was my understanding that asgiref played nicely with gevent/eventlet (with one thread created by asgiref) - testing at the moment suggests it is unstable under race conditions. I think this can be fixed and asgiref running within a gevent patched world is feasible.\r\n\r\nSo we are back talking about greenlets. :)\r\n\r\nIf there was a made-for-greenlets asgiref then this might be a good solution. Monkey-patching in eventlet/gevent is nice, but definitely not something you want to force, since it is incompatible with lots of things. The fact remains that you still have the two parallel universes taking through that little communication pipe between the sync and the async threads. And the sync side would not be using asyncio at all. In my proposed solution when I issue async I/O through an eventlet file descriptor I'm actually using the asyncio loop, so the two worlds are much closer to each other.\r\n\r\n> > but there are really a lot of options, including gunicorn, waitress, maybe even meinheld.\r\n>\r\n> Is this by starting an event loop and then running gunicorn (etc) within it? Or is there an easier solution I'm missing?\r\n\r\nLet's assume that I get eventlet fully running on top of asyncio. Now I can use any web server that uses eventlet on the asyncio loop. I can also use any standard web server that works with eventlet monkey-patching. In all cases everything runs on a single asyncio loop w/o any tricks outside of context switching with `greenlet.switch()`. I've tested this with the default select-based loop and also with uvloop and both are quite happy allowing greenlets to do their thing.\r\n\r\n> If I understand correctly if an await_ can be defined and used then these solutions are possible.\r\n\r\nI'm sure you can find more bridging solutions, but that's not what I'm talking about. Back to the parallel universe idea, I want a merged universe, not a passage between the two worlds.\r\n\r\nFor reference, there is an interesting conversation about the greenlet idea between Mike and Yuri: https://bugs.python.org/issue22239?@ok_message=msg%20373192%20created%0Aissue%2022239%20message_count%2C%20messages%20edited%20ok&@template=item#msg373145.\n> I think no matter what we add, we'll get some confusion\r\n\r\nNot so much if this was an extension that people install voluntarily if they want to access this functionality. I actually think an extension is the perfect vehicle for what I'm doing as well, I don't believe any of this belongs in the core project until the day we have a perfect solution. Flask could limit itself to be an \"enabler\" of async solutions by having the `ensure_async` wrapper, which could actually be a more generic `ensure_view` or something like that that takes anything you give it (not only coroutines) and returns a callable.\r\n\r\n> and neither proposal addresses request concurrency right now (beyond running a gevent worker, which isn't new).\r\n\r\nI understand your reasoning, but in my opinion this isn't fully accurate. You are implying that the only way to achieve concurrency is to add greenlets in some form. This is 100% true for Phil's solution. The greenlet based solution that I'm testing depends on greenlets for everything, and greenlets do their async business on pure asyncio without tricks. So you can't say that you need to \"add\" greenlets because greenlets are an integral part of this solution, and because of that scalability is not going to be something you need to decide if you want, you'll always have it whether you need it or not (as it should be, in my view).\r\n\nFYI, SQLAlchemy support for asyncio based on greenlets landed on master: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_14.html#asynchronous-io-support-for-core-and-orm.\r\n\r\nI have been working on https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/aioflask and have it working under a similar solution, but I still have some more work to do. For example, I'd like to enable the async render_template function for Jinja, and see in what other ways the experience for asyncio developers can be improved. But in any case, the core functionality of having async functions as handlers works really well, and I even managed to port one of the asyncio examples from Quart without having to make any changes to the handler logic.",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR discussion raises several critical technical issues regarding the asynchronous capabilities of Flask. Notably, the current implementation does not meaningfully address scalability limitations, which should be highlighted alongside performance metrics. The reviewer suggests enabling multiple async view functions to run concurrently within the same event loop to mitigate performance penalties, as the current approach restricts execution to one async function at a time.\n\nThere are security and architectural concerns with relying on greenlet context switching within asyncio tasks, which may not ensure race condition stability. It is suggested to consider alternatives like asgiref or Quart for structuring async support without greenlets. The integration of async SQLAlchemy was mentioned as potentially beneficial, underlining a need for a consistent async interface in Flask. Emphasis is placed on maintaining clear distinctions between synchronous and asynchronous operations to avoid user confusion, advocating for ensuring async functionality without requiring server adjustments."

If you have a fixed/low number of list entries, chances are good that you should be using a dict instead.\n\n> If you have a fixed/low number of list entries, chances are good that you should be using a dict instead.\n\nWhy is that? \n\nI've got API endpoints like `/categories/` and `/users/` that I want to return lists of items. I don't understand why a dict would make more sense than an array even if I've only got 4-5 categories.\n\nAgreed. \n\n`json.dumps()` only accepts the first item and appears to silently drop the others, so I considered copying that. It might be more natural as most people are used to the `dumps()` API. \n\nHowever, `jsonify()` currently accepts `**kwargs`, so I decided handling `*args` this way was more internally consistent.\n\nOverall, I think the divergence in accepted input between `json.dumps()` and `jsonify()` creates more confusion than convenience. Right now I sometimes forget which one supports `kwargs` and which supports arrays. And I'm not the only one who has [trouble remembering](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7907596/json-dumps-vs-flask-jsonify). \n\nSplitting behavior so `jsonify()` rejects `*args` but happily handles `**kwargs` just adds to the confusion, so we should pick either of the following:\n1. Make `jsonify()` internally consistent so it accepts both `*args` and `**kwargs`. \n2. Make `jsonify()` consistent with `dumps()`, meaning they both only accept a single argument. This implies a long term plan to deprecate  `jsonify(**kwargs)` so that it throws an exception just like `dumps(**kwargs)`.\n\nI don't care strongly, but if I had to pick I'd choose the latter because it's simpler to think of `jsonify()` as a `json.dumps()` that adds Flask niceties like the response class and serializing datetimes/UUIDs.\n\n> Maybe the solution to this mess is to introduce a new function that just invokes json.dumps and makes a response. Same behavior as json.dumps but with different name and makes a response object.\n\nIs there any reason to create a new function vs just modifying the existing `jsonify()` function? \n\nIt breaks backwards compatibility, but for a 1.0 release that should be fine. Also, I know in my own projects, I've never intentionally used `jsonify(**kwargs)`, I've just always passed it a dict, and I suspect most people use it similarly.\n\nTo me, the path of least surprise is to stay with the current `jsonify()` function name and remove the `**kwargs` support to be consistent with `dumps()`.\n\nThe other nicety that `jsonify()` currently has is serializing datetimes & UUIDs. If they weren't already in there, I wouldn't add them, but since they are in there, I'd just leave it in. \n\nI hear you. :-)\n\nMy vote is to stick with my original implementation where both `jsonify(1,2,3)` and `jsonify([1,2,3])` serialize to `[1,2,3]`. That behavior is a bit more loose than `dumps()`, but I think it's more convenient for the user and unlikely to trip up anyone unexpectedly. If anything, copying `dumps(1,2,3)` by serializing `jsonify(1,2,3)` to `1` is more likely to trip up someone. \n\n> Shouldn't jsonify with both args and kwargs fail?\n\nStill a very valid question, but I don't want it to delay merging this PR. For now, let's just stick with Flask's current behavior which is to accept both `args` and `kwargs` and serialize them to a dict. We can discuss changing that behavior in a separate issue or PR.\n\nThis needs a test case and docs to demonstrate exactly what is accepted by the function now.  The docs for the `jsonify` function can be improved.\n\nNote that as a side effect, simple types are accepted as well (`True`, `3.14`, etc.), so there should be a test/doc for that too.  Test both a single and multi character string.\n\nNot sure if I like that `*args` will be treated as an array, if it was me I'd make it always explicit, but it's not a huge deal.\n\nSome updates:\n1. Added tests.\n2. Moved around the existing `jsonify()` tests so they're located next to each other--before they were a little scattered. Other than relocating, I made minimal changes to existing tests.\n3. Expanded the docs for `jsonify()`. I'm not very familiar with RST/sphinx, so there might be some formatting issues I missed.\n4. Restructured the code handling the `*args`/`**kwargs` to be more explicit and linear. Previously, it wasn't always clear which combinations of `*args`/`**kwargs` would throw an exception and cause the `try`/`except` block to switch from dict to array.\n5. As part of this restructuring, made it so passing `args` + `kwargs` at the same time to `jsonify()` will fail as suggested by @ThiefMaster. After thinking about it more, I agree that this is the least surprising outcome rather than silently dropping either the `args` or `kwargs`.\n\nFeedback welcome. \n",

(=code 403), for which flask will provide a app-wide default. if no default user exception handler is registered, flask would return the debugger in debug mode and invoke the 500 (default or not) handler elsewise.\n\nIMO a rewrite would simply work the same way Python's exception-handling works: There are no \"403-handlers\" (or any handlers for status codes), just handlers for exceptions. If there is no handler for ForbiddenSubclass, the handler for Forbidden would be used.\n\nwell first off, yeah, codes and classes would be synonymous: `@app.errorhandler(403)` would do the same as `@app.errorhandler(Forbidden)`.\n\nbut moving on, i’m not exactly sure what you mean:\n\nin python, an exception handler is a try/except clause. the except clause that first matches the exception while it’s bubbling up the stack wins.\n\nbut we want to register exception handlers via decorators, so the intuition is: error handlers are independently from stack depth and order. at least my intuition is that module-level decorators are order-independent: i don’t expect the order in which i place my functions to have any impact, except when one is an override of the other.\n\nso i guess the least surprising thing to do is:\n\n``` python\nclass ForbiddenSub(Forbidden): pass\n\n@app.errorhandler(ForbiddenSubClass)\ndef x(e): ...\n\n@app.errorhandler(403)\ndef y(e): ...\n\n#replaces y because synonymous. we should throw a warning here\n@app.errorhandler(Forbidden)\ndef z(e): ...\n\n@app.errorhandler(500)\ndef w(e): ...\n\ndef test_a():\n    raise Forbidden()\n    # triggers z, since z replaces y\n\ndef test_b():\n    raise ForbiddenSubclass()\n    # triggers x, because x is more specific than z (the Forbidden handler)\n\ndef test_c():\n    raise TypeError()\n    # user exception triggers the debugger or “w”, depending on debug settings\n\ndef test_d():\n    raise ImATeapot()\n    # triggers the default 418 handler since we defined none\n```\n\nand blueprints work the same, except that there are no blueprint-wide defaults: any class of Exceptions (e.g. Forbidden subclasses or user exceptions) will be routed to the app’s handlers if there are no fitting handlers registered on the blueprint.\n\nWith \"like Python\" I mostly meant to match only by exception type and not any codes.\n\n> the except clause that first matches the exception while it’s bubbling up the stack wins\n\nThat's what I am suggesting. I think the algorithm for `find_most_specific_for` would be too costly to implement at runtime, but also multiple inheritance would further complicate the behavior. I'm advocating a behavior where the order of registration determines which errorhandler gets called, which is IIRC what is currently implemented. So apart from removing special-casing for HTTP codes, nothing would change.\n\nYes, but it's how python exception handling works, and how Flask's currently does too.\n\n> no. afaik there is no concept of error handlers\n\nI am only talking about the \"algorithm\" used for prioritization:\n- Python exception handling: The _first_ matching except-clause (in the order specified) is used\n- Flask exception handling: The _first_ matching errorhandler (in the order registered) is used\n\nAs opposed to finding the _most specific_ error handler (or except-clause) for an exception.\n\n> maybe, but nobody seems to use it in an advanced way\n\nThat's a really strong assumption, and I think it's impossible to avoid advanced usage in any sufficiently complex Flask app.\n\nNote that I am not really opposed to a new behavior, but I can't really imagine that the benefit of \"intuitiveness\" would outweigh the new learning curve. Because, while ordering by registration time might seem counterintuitive, the behavior is easily explained, while a more complex ranking algorithm probably requires much more learning effort. For example, even with \"specifity\" defined, how should ties be resolved? Sorting by registration time passes that responsibility off to the user.\n\n> if i’m the first one realizing that @app.errorhandler(ForbiddenSubclass) doesn’t work\n\nIt does work for me (yes, with all the bugs), it doesn't with the bugs fixed.\n\n> - Python exception handling: The first matching except-clause (in the order specified) is used\n> - Flask exception handling: The first matching errorhandler (in the order registered) is used\n> \n> As opposed to finding the most specific error handler (or except-clause) for an exception\n\nOK, gotcha. i still think that the mental model of registering handlers via decorators is _horizontal_ and _declarative_, while the mental model with handlers is tied to the structure of the code, i.e. the call stack and is therefore _vertical_ and _sequential_.\n\nalso in our case, handlers are endpoints, as in they return responses, whereas except clauses are just there in the code and either let things flow on or reraise the exceptions. both of those things reinforce the disparate mental models associated with the approaches.\n\napart from reacting to exceptions, those two approaches have nothing in common, look and feel very different. and again: top level function definitions (unlke nested ones inside of a function) have a order-independent feel to them, as have decorators. **and every API i ever used made that work**, by only breaking that mental model if you override something existing (mostly accidentally)\n\ni think my idea is just adequate API design, whereas the way things work right now is surprising for everything but simple cases (where it works identically to my approach)\n\n> […] For example, even with \"specifity\" defined, how should ties be resolved? Sorting by registration time passes that responsibility off to the user.\n\nwell, it still comes down to registration order when there are overrides and times. i just think that this behavior (in a ”note” box in the docs) is still more intuitive than e.g. following scenario:\n\n``` python\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n[...]\n\napp.errorhandler(403)\ndef default_forbidden():\n    return 'You’re not allowed to do that', 403\n\n```\n\nand somewhere else\n\n``` python\n@app.errorhandler(CheatException)\ndef cheat(e):\n    return '''\n        You thought you’d get through with faking your score\n        while it really is {e.real_score}\n    '''.format(e=e), CheatException.code\n\n@app.route('/submit_score/<score>')\ndef submit_score(score):\n    if not internal_score == score:\n        raise CheatException(internal_score)\n```\n\nNow add templates and more complexity and have fun debugging why you raised a CheatException for which you clearly just defined a handler (it’s right there, for god’s sake!) and still some nondescript 403 page came!\n\n> It does work for me (yes, with all the bugs), it doesn't with the bugs fixed.\n\nhuh? my pull request is incomplete and naive, made at a point where i thought the rest of the code worked as it seemed like it should, but it turns out that the tests rely on broken functionality, thus our discussion here. what do you actually use? what works? what doesn’t? what fixed bugs are you talking about?\n\nby the way: i found a very simple and efficient implementation for my idea (example only with app, not blueprint).\n\nhalf-pseudocode prototype:\n\n``` python\n\nclass DefaultHandlers(object):\n    def __getitem__(self, code):\n        description = http_codes.get(code)\n        if description is not None:\n            return lambda e: '<h1>Error {}</h1>\\n{}<br>{}'.format(code, description, e)\n        else:\n            raise KeyError(code)\n\nFlask.handlers = ChainMap({}, DefaultHandlers())\n# for blueprint: ChainMap({}, app.handlers, DefaultHandlers())\n\ndef is_http_exception(error_class_or_instance):\n    return (\n        isinstance(error_class_or_instance, HTTPException) or\n        isinstance(error_class_or_instance, type) and\n        issubclass(error_class_or_instance, HTTPException))\n\n\ndef Flask.get_handlers(self, e):\n    code = e.code if is_http_exception(e) else None # None: user exception\n    return self.handlers.setdefault(code, {})\n\ndef Flask.register_errorhandler(self, error_class, handler_function):\n    assert issubclass(error_class, Exception)\n    self.get_handlers(error_class)[error_class] = handler_function\n\ndef Flask.find_appropriate_handler(e):\n    assert isinstance(error_class, Exception)\n    handlers = self.get_handlers(e)\n    for error_class in type(e).mro():\n        handler = handlers.get(error_class)\n        if hander is not None:\n            return handler(e)\n```\n\nwell, what you say will still work after that of course.\n\nwhat won’t work is\n1. registering error handlers on exception _instances_ (i’m pretty sure nobody does that, since it would require understanding the broken code, which would have led to someone else filing this very bug)\n2. relying on the order and registering a more generic exception handler before a more specific one and relying on the former being triggered (which would be broken code anyway: why would you want to register an error handler which will per definition never be triggered, like the latter one in this example)\n\nIf you put them in the correct order, your goal is possible:\n\n```\nfrom flask import Flask\nfrom werkzeug.exceptions import Forbidden\n\nclass Cheated(Forbidden):\n    pass\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.errorhandler(Cheated)\ndef cheated(e):\n    return \"cheated!\"\n\n@app.errorhandler(403)  # works with either 403 or Forbidden as arg\ndef custom_forbidden(e):\n    return \"forbidden\"\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    raise Cheated()\n\nwith app.test_client() as c:\n    assert c.get('/').data == 'cheated!'\n```\n\nNo, you'll see whatever your custom exception tells Flask to show. For example, here are some custom JSON exception classes from a project of mine:\n\n``` python\nclass JSONException(HTTPException):\n    links = None\n\n    def __init__(self, links=None, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(JSONException, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.links = links or {}\n\n    def get_links(self):\n        return {name: {'href': href} for name, href in self.links}\n\n    def get_headers(self, environ=None):\n        return [('Content-Type', 'application/vnd.error+json')]\n\n    def get_body(self, environ=None):\n        return {'message': self.description, '_links': self.get_links()}\n\n    def get_response(self, environ=None):\n        rv = json.dumps(self.get_body(environ), indent=2)\n        return current_app.response_class(rv, self.code, self.get_headers(environ))\n\n\nclass ValidationError(JSONException):\n    code = 400\n    description = _('Validation error')\n\n    def __init__(self, errors=[], *args, **kwargs):\n        super(ValidationError, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.errors = errors\n\n    def get_body(self, environ=None):\n        rv = super(ValidationError, self).get_body(environ)\n        if self.errors:\n            rv['_embedded'] = {'errors': self.errors}\n            rv['total'] = len(self.errors)\n        return rv\n\n\nclass SearchQueryError(ValidationError):\n    description = _('Invalid search query')\n\n\nclass AuthenticationError(JSONException):\n\n    def get_headers(self, environ=None):\n        return super(AuthenticationError, self).get_headers() + [\n            ('WWW-Authenticate', 'JWT realm=\"Login Required\"')\n        ]\n\n\nclass Unauthenticated(AuthenticationError):\n    code = 401\n    description = _('Authentication required')\n\n\nclass Unauthorized(AuthenticationError):\n    code = 403\n    description = _('Unauthorized')\n\n\nclass ResourceNotFound(JSONException):\n    code = 404\n    description = _('Resource not found')\n```\n\nNo where in my app have I registered these exceptions to be handled by my application.

The proposed patch breaks existing tests, suggesting a misalignment with intended functionality (refer to failing builds on Travis CI). It is recommended that the patch applies to the `0.10-maintenance` branch first before merging into master, and the author should add a test that reflects the newly introduced behavior.\n\nSeveral implementation approaches are discussed, including the removal of special handling for `HTTPException` subclasses, treating all exceptions uniformly. However, this raises concerns about maintaining intended behavior across varying subclass scenarios. An alternative solution proposes modifying error handlers to prioritize specificity in exception type identification rather than just status codes.\n\nComplexity and potential performance impacts of a new subclass registry for handlers are noted, posing a significant architectural concern. The suggestion to intercept error handler assignments hints at a more maintainable system but may complicate existing paradigms. Finally, there are calls for clarity on registration order for handlers and its implications for behavior that diverges from expected behavior in Python’s native exception handling."

It doesn't make sense that we'd add what should be a subclass of dict to the union which already has dict. Please report this to MyPy and/or Python first.\r\n> \r\n> Seems like this is relevant in MyPy: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12934\r\n\r\nI don't believe it's a bug in MyPy or TypedDict per se. According to its typing interface, a TypedDict exposes fewer methods than a dict does, even though at runtime it's really just a dict. So from a typing perspective it makes sense to not allow a TypedDict to be accepted by a function that accepts a Dict. Otherwise, this would be valid:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass DefinitelyContainsStatus(TypedDict):\r\n    status: str\r\n\r\ndef delete_status(d: dict):\r\n    del d['status']\r\n\r\nd: DefinitelyContainsStatus = {'status': 'ok'}\r\ndelete_status(d)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you'd have a `DefinitelyContainsStatus` dict that doesn't contain `status`.\r\n\r\nFlask doesn't do anything of the sort; it doesn't modify the dict at all. So it should be able to accept dicts typed as TypedDict.\r\n\r\nHowever, you are right about the ambiguity. Perhaps the right approach is not to add `TypedDict` to `ResponseValue`, but instead to replace `Dict[str, Any]` with `Mapping[str, Any]`? That does accept TypedDicts.\nIn my testing `typing._TypedDict` is a valid type in unions, and MyPy does consider actual TypedDicts to be a member of that type and therefore a member of the union. So that would solve the problem for 3.8 and later.\r\n\r\nHowever Python 3.7 still poses a problem, there's no TypedDict in the 3.7 standard library and I don't see a way to get it working with the one provided by typing_extensions.\r\n\r\nWould it be agreeable to add a version check, so that on 3.7 the current union is used and for 3.8+ `typing._TypedDict` is added? Similar version-dependent code exists for example in `src/flask/app.py` for `iscoroutinefunction`.\ntyping_extensions imports fine:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif t.TYPE_CHECKING:\r\n    import typing_extensions as te\r\n\r\n...\r\n    \"te.TypedDict\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've already tried all this, it makes other things fail, which also fail with `typing.TypedDict`. I don't plan to add a dependency on some `_` prefixed type either, that seems likely to break. Take it up with MyPy.\nThat doesn't import fine, because the import is done within the `TYPE_CHECKING` guard but the union is defined outside. CI fails when done that way: https://github.com/pallets/flask/actions/runs/2669339095\r\n\r\nCan you tell me more about the failures you're referring to? Aside from the Python 3.7 based environments nothing appears to break in CI. It doesn't seem to fail for our Flask application either which uses TypedDicts all over the place.\nI'm not sure what CI you're looking at. The CI for this PR has failures everywhere. When I fix the TypedDict import, it causes more failures, which then cascade to other areas.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/flask/typing.py:16: error: Variable \"typing_extensions.TypedDict\" is not valid as a type  [valid-type]\r\nsrc/flask/typing.py:16: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#variables-vs-type-aliases\r\n```\nIt's not a issue from MyPy's point of view, as I've detailed above in https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/4695#issuecomment-1184473249.\r\n\r\nBeing able to pass a TypedDict to an interface that accepts dict, means that this interface can modify the dict without regard to the type invariants afforded by TypedDict, so any remaining references to that TypedDict cannot rely on its type invariants still being held. Therefore, the MyPy error is correct and this is not an issue with the MyPy project.\r\n\r\nAlso, the MyPy project will tell you that Mapping is the appropriate type to accept, since Flask does not modify the dict and TypedDicts do satisfy the Mapping protocol.\nDo you suppose that type checking is the right place to enforce this, at the cost of not being able to solve real-world problems? You can already return any non-dict Mapping if you simply don't use type checkers and it will still break visibly.\r\n\r\nRight now, Flask's typing.py rejects valid real-world usage. Adding `Mapping` solves this real-world problem and makes the typing situation strictly better than it was in 2.1.2.\n> Do you suppose that type checking is the right place to enforce this\r\n\r\nYes, given that the entire point of type checking is to describe the correct types and catch things before runtime. If they're not able to do that, that's a design issue that needs to be fixed with typing or type checkers.\r\n\r\n> Right now, Flask's typing.py rejects valid real-world usage.\r\n\r\nBut with `Mapping`, it would accept invalid uses, so that doesn't seem \"strictly better\" just \"different for that specific use case\".\nI've pushed a change to use `typing_extensions.TypedDict`. I've also temporarily bumped MyPy's Python version to 3.8. Notice that the error \"TypedDict is not valid as a type\" is shown whether you use it from `typing` or `typing_extensions`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/flask/typing.py:15: error: Variable \"typing_extensions.TypedDict\" is not valid as a type  [valid-type]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/flask/typing.py:15: error: Variable \"typing.TypedDict\" is not valid as a type  [valid-type]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact that it fails with MyPy in 3.8 mode suggests that the `sys.version` check is just masking the type completely, hiding the new issue. So that doesn't seem like a valid solution.\r\n\r\nIf this cannot be solved without using `Mapping`, that needs to be reported to typing, as it's forcing a less precise type when that shouldn't be required. Please open an issue about that and link it here before I merge this.\nWell, I definitely agree there's a contravariance problem when sending a TypedDict to a dict receiver, but I'm not sure what the typing or MyPy projects could theoretically do to resolve this.\r\n\r\nSuppose they could define a `WeakTypedDict` that's still a dict at runtime and that can validly be sent to a dict receiver. But then type checkers would lose the ability to reason correctly about the contents of that dict, which isn't a desirable outcome.\r\n\r\nStill, I shall open a issue there and link it here.\nFor Flask's purpose though, it doesn't matter what the contents are. You want to check the return value of your own function, where it does matter. But `route` and `make_response` only care that it's a dict, and specifically a dict and not another mapping.",

If you don't explicitly enable debug via configuration at Flask app instantiation then access the `jinja_env`, template auto reloading is disabled. If you then subsequently enable debug by starting the server with `app.run(debug=True)`, Werkzeug debugging and reloading is enabled (regardless of the fact it wasn't otherwise explicitly enabled via config) but template auto reloading isn't enabled.\n\nI think the intention is that calling `app.run(debug=True)` should enable debugging and auto reloading.

Please excuse my brevity.\n\nAh, I understand now @untitaker.\n\nSorry, I missed that comment. You're right in that we're clobbering any configuration set value from `create_jinja_environment`, and this probably isn't the best course of action.\n\nThe difficulty here is that between instantiating our Flask app and calling `app.run()` there are a few places that template auto reloading could be enabled or disabled.\n\nMy proposed patch works for most scenarios but fails for the one you've highlighted - if we explicitly disable template auto reloading (using any of the above mechanisms) then call `app.run(debug=True)`, we clobber our explicit disablement of template reloading. And that's probably not ideal.\n\n@justanr's comment that we might want to use `options['use_reloader']` rather than `debug` makes some sense, but could this cause further confusion by tying Jinja template autoreloading to Werkzeug reloading in one place (`app.run`) but no-where else?\n\nI think you're right in that moving the logic for TEMPLATE_AUTO_RELOAD into `app.run` might be the solution. We'd have to make sure that nothing else fails and no behaviours change as a result of template auto-reloading not being configured one way or another before `app.run` (i.e. make sure nothing expects some value to be there before `app.run`).\n\nWhat does Jinja do if  `auto_reload` is not set? Does it have a sensible default behaviour?\n\nIf so, we could probably just move that block from `create_jinja_environment` into `run` pretty much wholesale. Would this be a better solution?\n\nActually, that might not work without some more changes.\n\nI don't believe `run()` is called at all in WSGI apps, so that couldn't be the only place that we set `jinja_env.auto_reload`.\n\nActually, https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/1910#issuecomment-226035937 might not matter as I don't think the Werkzeug auto reloader works in a WSGI environment (could someone please confirm?).\n\nIf we don't auto reload code in a WSGI environment, keeping the template auto reloader configuration in `app.run()` would make sense and keep things consistent.\n\nHowever, it would appear that Jinja defaults to auto_reload=True. `test_templates_auto_reload` expects unconfigured auto reload to default to False.\n\nMoving the config code from `create_jinja_environment` would mean that between instantiating the Flask app and calling `app.run()`, the config in `app.config` would be ignored. This wouldn't work. And running it was a WSGI app would leave the reloader on by default (not the currently established behaviour).\n\nI think we'll need a different approach (clobbering the value in `app.run()` as per the original patch is starting to look more pragmatic now).\n\nSo, I'm at a loss. I've tried every proposed solution I've been able to find, without luck. My locally run Flask app completely ignores any changes made to my html template files, no matter what I do. I've even redefined the location of the template folder via `template_folder=template_dir` - doesn't change a thing. Cleared browser cache, changed browsers. Nothing.\r\n\r\nI've tried every permutation of setting debug and auto_reload I can think of. I currently have it running with a solution proposed in this thread (code below) - no errors, but still it completely ignores any changes made to template html files. \r\n\r\nAm I going mad? What could I be missing?\r\n\r\nEDIT: nevermind, realized I wasn't even calling the file I'd been editing. New to flask :)",
    "sumarized_length": 1100,
    "summarized_comments": "In the PR discussion, a key issue raised involves the handling of the `TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD` setting, which influences Jinja's `auto_reload` behavior when the Flask app runs. The current implementation defaults to `None`, meaning it depends on debug mode. When enabling debug with `app.run(debug=True)` without prior explicit configuration, it results in Werkzeug reloading activity but does not activate template auto reloading. This inconsistency has raised confusion.\n\nTo improve clarity, moving the logic for `TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD` from `create_jinja_environment` to `app.run()` is suggested. However, this change may overlook configurations established prior to invoking `app.run()`, potentially leading to unwanted overriding of user-defined `auto_reload` settings.\n\nFurther discussions highlighted concerns about maintaining coherent behavior across different environments, particularly WSGI, where `app.run()` may not be executed. The resolution requires careful consideration of Jinja's default behaviors and ensuring existing configurations are honored without contradicting user intents."

    "unsumarized_comments": "It would be good to:\r\n\r\n- Preserve order when using `predict_generator` with multiple processes, at no performance cost\r\n- Offer a way to easily add enqueuing capabilities to any source of data. Currently we kind of have that by requiring people to write generators. But the experience of writing these could be improved.\r\n\r\nThis should be achieved in a fully backwards compatible way. Do you see a solution?\nUsing a [manager](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes) or [pipes](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#exchanging-objects-between-processes), processes could communicate which input (or index) they have processed. This is rather ugly, but this would work.\r\n\r\nThis could cause memory issues, but if you're using predict_generator, I guess you're not outputting images. ( In this case, switching predict_generator to output a generator would help people in the segmentation domain like myself. Quick suggestion) This is why I recommend to add [futures](http://pythonhosted.org/futures/) to the dependencies for Py2 since it's only a \r\nbackport from the real module in Py3.\r\n\r\nAdding helper functions to handle many types of data would have to be done. Most of them would be easy to do (Numpy, Directory, HDF5), but handling generators would be really difficult. Of course, the community would have to adapt.\r\n\r\n\n@PavlosMelissinos may want to comment on this since he is working on a dataset API as well & trying to consider segmentation https://github.com/PavlosMelissinos/enet-keras/blob/master/src/data/datasets.py#L14\n@fchollet I'll be working on a blog post about the changes and how to update generators to Dataset. Should be really easy to do the transition. Previously, people were doing\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor x,y in X_train,Y_train:\r\n    yield resize(imread(x),(200,200)),y\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow it would be\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass CIFAR10Dataset(Dataset):\r\n    def __init__(self,x_set,y_set):\r\n        self.X,self.y = x_set,y_set\r\n    def __len__(self):\r\n        return len(self.X)\r\n    def __getitem__(self,idx):\r\n        return resize(imread(self.X[idx]),(200,200)),self.y[idx]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere X_train would be a list of filename containing images for example and Y_train their classes.\r\nSo a little more of boilerplate code, but most people were already using objects to encapsulate their generator.\r\n\r\nProblems that I can think of: \r\n* ImageDataGenerator will need to be remade in a future PR\r\n* People who were doing funky stuff with generators like making then process-safe won't need that anymore. May be disturbing.\r\n* Non-OO people will not like this change.\r\n\r\nFor real, there should not be any major problem with Dataset, and generators will still be around for a while.\r\n\nOrthogonally, we seriously need a way to make Theano tests less slow. They take 5x longer than other backends (we now have several other backends!), even though there is generally less tests being run than on TF. Maybe changing compilation mode would do it?\nI'm really not experienced with Theano sorry. Is there a Theano master in the community?\r\n\r\nFor the deps on futures, it could be an optional dependency. So the default behaviour would still be GeneratorEnqueuer, but if you give a Dataset and you're using Python 2, you need to install future. The docs would need to reflect this thing as well. Just like h5py, pydot-ng is not a required deps.\r\n\r\n\n> Just like h5py, pydot-ng is not a required deps.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of this pattern in general, it has caused a bunch of problems and a lot of user frustration. Can we avoid it? Can Python 2.7 really not support something like this?\nJust a copy of Slack for diligent book keeping.\r\nThe most challenging point of your comment is the first one. You could chain Dataset I guess.\r\nlike\r\n```\r\nds = FileLoaderDataset(filenames) #generic file loading\r\nds = RandomTranslationDataset(ds)\r\nds = RandomShearDataset(ds)\r\n```\r\nIn their `__getitem__` they would have to do something like\r\n```\r\ndef RandomTranslationDataset(Dataset):\r\n    def __init__(ds):\r\n        self.ds = ds\r\n    def __getitem__(self,idx):\r\n        return self.random_translation(self.ds[idx])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my blog post (dref360.github.io), I found that the thing that sucks about tf.FIFOQueue is that is cannot run on different processes. This can.\r\n\r\nIn think this design is flexible enough to do pretty much whatever you want. We only want the input for frame `idx`, what you do to give the inputs is pretty much what you want.\r\n\r\nThis PR is pretty much WIP, I wanted some feedbacks, So the design is still pretty flexible\n@Dref360 \r\nSo how will `generator_predict` and `generator_evaluate` know when to stop getting batches?  Ideally we would want them to cover exactly one epoch of the (test) dataset. Right now the user needs to calculate the number of batches to process in advance before calling those generator functions. \r\n\r\nThis seems cumbersome, since the Dataset object knows when an epoch is over, so why bother the user?\r\n\r\nAlso, this is inherently problematic in the (common) case where the length of the dataset is not divisible by the batch size, because the Dataset will just cycle on to the next epoch, and that means you will either double-count the first test samples or miss the last test samples.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should have an option to just go through a single epoch and yield a StopIteration when over?\r\n\r\n\nWhen Keras went from version 1.0 to 2.0, `fit_generator` started to asked for the number of batches instead of the number of samples. \r\n\r\nThis behaviour needs to stay there for GeneratorEnqueuer which does not know the number of batches. I guess the `n_steps` in `fit_generator` could be ignored when using a DatasetEnqueuer and just get the length of the Dataset. Is that what you're saying? \n## TL;DR: Dataset API needs front + backends just like Models & Layers\r\n\r\nI think the API in this PR is a great start that could improve even more with additional love and care. I think it could run faster and work in more general use cases by incorporating inspiration from:\r\n\r\n - Keras Container/Model/Layer and their backends\r\n - [tf.contrib.data.Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/data/Dataset), a new [input pipeline API for TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7951)\r\n - Scalable [TensorFlow high performance models guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_models) with the corresponding [data_flow_ops.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py). (tl;dr summary below)\r\n\r\n### The Design, I need your ideas to refine it!\r\n\r\nHere is an mnist example with the truly important parts, details & links are below:\r\n```python\r\nclass YieldOp:\r\n   # like Keras.Layer merged with a generator\r\n   # see explanation below code\r\n\r\n# assume mnist was saved as an npy file and that\r\n# NumpyInput is a YieldOp implementation\r\n# The returns are all Keras tensors, not numpy arrays!\r\nX_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = keras.NumpyInput(\r\n    ['mxtrain.npy', 'mytrain.npy', 'mxtest.npy', 'mytest.npy'])\r\n\r\n# build a cnn as usual\r\ncon1 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', strides=(2, 2), padding='valid')(x_train)\r\ncon2 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', strides=(2, 2))(con1)\r\nfla1 = Flatten()(con2)\r\nden1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(fla1)\r\nx_train_out = Dense(classes, activation='softmax')(den1)\r\n\r\n# Inputs are already known due to\r\n# keras.NumpyInput, a YieldOp!\r\ntrain_model = keras.Model(outputs=[x_train_out, y_train])\r\ntrain_model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',\r\n                    loss='categorical_crossentropy',\r\n                    metrics=['accuracy'])\r\ntrain_model.fit(batch_size=10, epochs=300)\r\nscore = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)\r\nprint('Test loss:', score[0])\r\nprint('Test accuracy:', score[1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an expanded example with how a more complex segmentation train/test script might work. There extra hypothetical APIs for illustrative reasons that aren't required for this proposal:\r\n```python\r\nclass RecordInput(YieldOp):\r\n   # a YieldOp example\r\n   # see tf.RecordInput and related links below code\r\n   __init__(self, globPath)\r\n\r\nclass PythonFunction():\r\n   # see tf.py_func\r\n\r\n# TODO generators defined in this PR would become YieldOp implementations\r\n# might utilize PythonFunction for that\r\ndatainput = keras.RecordInput(\"*.tfrecord\")\r\n\r\ndataset = keras.Dataset(datainput, ordering=['shuffle', 'parallel'])(datainput)\r\n\r\n# let's say this is segmentation so labels are images too\r\nlabels = dataset.get_feature('labels')\r\nimages = dataset.get_feature('images')\r\n\r\n[labels, images] = keras.image.Preprocessor([labels, images], ['flip_horizontal', 'flip_vertical', keras.image.Zoom(0,1)])\r\n\r\n\r\ncnn_output = cnn_layers(images)\r\n\r\n# how dimensionality of labels is communicated, needs second pass\r\nlabelmap = keras.LabelMap(labels=labels, output=cnn_output, ['batch','data','data','class'])\r\n\r\n# Inputs are already known due to\r\n# keras.RecordInput, a YieldOp!\r\ntrain_model = keras.Model(outputs=[cnn_output, labelmap])\r\ntrain_model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',\r\n                    loss='categorical_crossentropy',\r\n                    metrics=['accuracy'])\r\ntrain_model.fit(batch_size=10, epochs=300)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe must create a more general and flexible keras dataset frontend with `keras.Dataset` redesigned to work like `keras.Model`, and design a new `keras.Preprocessing` class.\r\n\r\n1. Define a new `Keras.YieldOp` which is analogous to `keras.Layer` combined with a generator, and generates data of any kind.\r\n    - [RecordInput](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8118ab4ec9b354dd598c2355d3a84f1275543adc/tensorflow/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py#L2137) provides `get_yield_op()`, I have an example in #6298, [read_and_decode_recordinput()](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-5d4b217f28eee8c68337324ed48f12adR97) see also [TensorFlow high performance models guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_models)\r\n    - Adapt the current generators and `Dataset` in this PR to implement `keras.YieldOp`.\r\n2. Support a high performance, scalable pipeline in the tf backend inspired by the [TensorFlow high performance models guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_models). \r\n    - Other backends can be implemented in `backends/python.py` with pure python and code adapted from this pull request until they can provide their own complying implementation (since Keras is a spec).\r\n3. Define a `keras.PythonFunction`, see [tf.py_func](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/py_func)\r\n    - Make it easy to meet the requirements of `Keras.YieldOp`\r\n    - adapt exising generators, flow_from_directory, etc.\r\n4. Define our new `keras.Dataset` API using the above tools\r\n    - `keras.Dataset` should provide reasonable defaults and a few functions/ops which help make it easy to support a variety of different datasets. \r\n    - This step needs more thought, `keras.Model` and perhaps [tf.contrib.data.Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/data/Dataset) can provide inspiration.\r\n5. future work: `keras.Preprocessing`\r\n\r\n\r\n### [tl;dr for TensorFlow high performance models guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_models)\r\n\r\nHere is how it goes on one machine:\r\n\r\n1.

[StagingArea](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/data_flow_ops.py#L1556) stores data for efficient prefetching and copying to the GPU\r\n5. Execute the core training loop.\r\n\r\nRead the article for the distributed part :-)\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nIf this sounds at first like reimplementing TensorFlow in Keras, I assure you it is not. There are a couple very nice designs in the new TF APIs, and we should consider the best elements of Keras' design, TensorFlow's design, and the other backends to inspire an excellent, easy to understand, best practices by default, usable, and reusable Keras API spec. If the final design is completely different from this, that's okay, but I'm hoping some of these ideas are compelling! :-)\r\n\r\n**edit:** added mnist example and clarified what's key and what's conceptual in the code snippet.\nNot really in the scope of this PR imo. This PR is to fix a bug where pickle_safe=True would not guarantee the order of the inputs. \r\n\r\nAlso, while your proposition is great, it would be a burden for futures backend. The Keras API is already kinda big. \r\n\r\nKeras is for quick experimentation and your proposition seems like a library by itself.\n@Dref360 Could you comment more specifically on https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6891#issuecomment-307659460 after a second, closer look? The really important parts are understanding `YieldOp` and the tl;dr at the top.\r\n\r\nI hope the fact that I considered segmentation (see #6538) wasn't too distracting. Datasets can have [much more complexity](https://sites.google.com/site/brainrobotdata/home) than 2 channels. I'll think of a simpler MNIST example.\r\n\r\nAlso, I realized there is no example code for this pull request, can you create something?\nOkay I added the mnist example to https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6891#issuecomment-307659460, hopefully that makes it clear how this actually simplifies usage! \r\n\r\n#6298 illustrates why this shouldn't need to be overly difficult to implement.\n> it would be a burden for future backends\r\n\r\nI think you missed my explanation of `backends/python.py`, which solves that problem! We don't need to rewrite theano or cntk. I know I wrote a lot, but I also considered a lot. :-)\r\n\r\nI also realized `backends/common.py` should be `backends/python.py` because TF doesn't need it and then theano + cntk can access it, I'm going to edit my comments above accordingly.\nSure I'm cool with moving `Dataset` discussion elsewhere if you'd prefer to change the PR to a narrow pickling fix. In that case I recommend these changes in addition to the other outstanding review changes:\r\n\r\n1. delete the `Dataset` class\r\n2. rename everything else like `DatasetEnqueuer` to `SequenceEnqueuer` or the equivalent\r\n3. Add docs to [fit_generator](https://github.com/Dref360/keras/blob/d3545542766ad8daffeb8951151427eb73e68b23/keras/engine/training.py#L1635), `evaluate_generator`, and `predict_generator` specifying that each supports a Generator and a [collections.abc.Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html?highlight=abc%20sequence#module-collections.abc). \r\n    - Question: will [collections.abc.Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html?highlight=abc%20sequence#module-collections.abc) have python 2.7.x vs 3.x problems? \r\n4. Create a test where a [collections.abc.Sequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html?highlight=abc%20sequence#module-collections.abc) is passed to `fit_generator`, `evaluate_generator`, `predict_generator`, pickled & unpickled twice at different iterations and compared to verify the change actually fixes the pickling problem.\r\n5. Question: should the [version number be changing](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6891/files#diff-2eeaed663bd0d25b7e608891384b7298R6)?\r\n\r\nThat sound OK with you?",

The proposal to include helper functions for various data types (Numpy, directories, HDF5) is noted, while raising the difficulty of handling generators. \n\nIt suggests making `futures` an optional dependency for Python 2 users and emphasizes the importance of maintaining backward compatibility.

    "unsumarized_comments": "Thanks for the effort.\r\n\r\nYou are misunderstanding the meaning of the \"trainable\" property of layers. Historically, it has initially meant \"this layer should not be trainable, i.e. the weights of this layer should not be updated during backprop (specifically `layer.trainable_weights` should be empty)\". Then it has been extend to mean \"the state of the layer should be frozen during training\" (which means that, in addition to the previous definition, layer updates are not run).\r\n\r\nWhat you want is a BN layer in inference mode. There is an argument to control training/inference mode in BN (and other layers): it's the `training` argument in `call` (boolean).\r\n\r\nWhat you want is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = BatchNormalization()(y, training=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor fine-tuning, you could do something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Set up inference-mode base\r\nK.set_learning_phase(0)\r\ninputs = Input(...)\r\nx = layer1(...)(inputs)\r\nx = layer2(...)(x)\r\n...\r\nx = layerN(...)(x)\r\n\r\n# Add training-mode layers\r\nK.set_learning_phase(1)\r\nx = layerNp1(...)(x)\r\nx = layerNp2(...)(x)\r\n```\nHi @fchollet,\r\n\r\nFirst of all thanks for taking the time to review and respond. I was aware that this is a significant change in the default behaviour and that there would be debate. :)\r\n\r\nI understand that your main concern is around the semantic meaning of the trainable property and how it is being used in this PR. I agree that semantically the training parameter that you proposed is closer to what I do, nevertheless this parameter can't change after the network definition. For instance when you use one of the pre-trained models of keras or when you load a persisted model you have no control over this variable. Would you be open to discuss a solution that would make the training variable changeable after the network definition (or perhaps another property)? If you are open to this, I could update my PR to reflect the agreed behaviour.\r\n\r\nConcerning your second recommendation of updating the learning_phase as the network is defined, I see two limitations:\r\n1) Again this will work only if the network is defined based on code. It will not work for the pretrained models of Keras or when a model is loaded from disk. The latter is quite important; models are trained in multiple rounds usually after restoring them from checkpoints.\r\n2) After setting the learning_phase(1) in your example, the learning_phase will be static for the remaining of the session. This will overwrite all the nice mechanisms that keras has for switching between phases depending on whether it trains or predicts. Thus if we call fit() with validation data, the model will predict while being in training mode.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you had a look on the blog post (it is understandably a bit long), but you can see how significant perfomance boost you get by making it possible to set the BN in inference mode. Without this the trainable layers after the BNs adjust their weights based on input that has different scale (comparing to inference). I hope, we can re-open this PR; I'm happy to update it until it satisfies the semantic definitions.\r\n\r\nCheers!\nAgain, there is an existing API that does exactly what you want: the `training` argument in `call`. There is no point in having two differently name APIs that do the exact same thing. `layer.trainable = False` is not what you need, therefore don't use it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your proposed PR adds a computational overhead (which might amount to a ~5% slowdown for a BN-heavy model like InceptionV3) to every single convnet that uses BN, fine-tuning or not. This is a heavy price to pay for supporting an incrementally simpler UX (disputable) for a very specific use case.\r\n\r\n> For instance when you use one of the pre-trained models of keras or when you load a persisted model you have no control over this variable.\r\n\r\nTypically if you want to heavily modify an existing model, rather than merely use it in inference mode, you should have access to the code for the model.\r\n\r\nBut even if you don't, you can still do your style of fine-tuning in this case:\r\n- set learning phase to 0\r\n- load model\r\n- retrieve features you want to train on\r\n- set learning phase to 1\r\n- add new layers on top\r\n- optionally load weights from initial model layers to corresponding new layers\r\n- train\n@fchollet My main point is that the training argument can't be changed after model definition, so the existing API does not cover this valid case. I don't argue that there are workarounds, but they are hacky/non-elegant and the default behaviour leads to much confusion to users. Interesting what you mention about the 5% slow down, I would love to see the benchmarks; perhaps it can be resolved. Finally something you don't address here is whether this discrepancy in the scaling makes sense (theoretically or otherwise) and whether the accuracy decrease is worth it.\r\n\r\nAt any case, let's agree we disagree. I do hope though that you will revise your decision on the future, as it happened with the [update of the mini-batch statistics on the BN](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/4762#issuecomment-299606870). \nThanks for the clarifying that you are referring to a different benchmark and not to something you ran on this PR. I can't comment on the results without seeing them but when I ran comparisons on CIFAR10 the time difference was negligible (current branch: 4216 secs vs patched: 4251 secs); both ran on GPUs on the same server. Note that the snippet that I used (and listed on my article) comes from Keras' documentation on how to fine-tune a network.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the above measurements are **single point estimates** but especially the 5 point accuracy increase I report is consistent with what I've been observing for almost a year while applying workarounds (first time I reported this is on #7177). I don't know if the speed is currently your main concern for reopening this but I would say that this is unlikely to affect the majority of the users of Keras. This is because by default the Learning Phase is dynamic and the `training` argument of `call` is None. This will force the `in_train_phase` method on backend to use a switch statement that depends on learning phase, so in a sense the \"if\" statement is [already there](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py#L2883).\r\n\r\nAt any case I don't insist that it should me who changes this or that my current solution is the one we should use. I'm just raising a valid use case that is taken directly from [Keras' documentation](https://keras.io/applications/) on how fine-tuning is performed. Currently there is no straightforward way to do what I describe (the current API doesn't cover it), nevertheless if you provide specific guidelines on what tickboxes the update should check it would be useful. Or perhaps some other longtime contributor of the BatchNormalization layer has an opinion or can offer a more elegant solution on this? @ozabluda @taehoonlee @farizrahman4u @Dref360 \nWhat sort of batch sizes were you using in your linked experiments?\r\n\r\nSome datasets are only viable with very small batch sizes of 1-4, like with image segmentation on a GPU with 8GB of memory. After briefly skimming this diff, I think the documentation would need to be updated to clearly delineate the different modes and when/why each should typically be chosen. In my case the current frozen behavior improved performance quite a lot over the previous behavior in which mean/var could shift when trainable=False, so I'm a bit hesitant about this though I'll reiterate I haven't reviewed what's happening in full detail. \r\n\r\nHere is a PR with some past discussion on BN https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/8616\n@ozabluda First of all thank you for spending time on this. I wish I had provided on my PR the example that you posted on the issue #9214; perhaps this would have built a stronger case for this patch. What you showed on your post is exactly what I've been observing on real-world non-opensource datasets for the last year (close to 100% accuracy on training mode and 50% during inference on the same dataset and on similar validation sets). As @fchollet  said the are lots of hacks that can help you avoid it but none of them should have been necessary.\r\n\r\nBased on the code you provided, I'm 100% certain you are being bitten by the behaviour of the BN layer that I'm trying to fix in this PR. In a nutshell, during training mode the frozen BN layers are scaled with different statistics than in inference mode. There is absolutely no theoretical foundation to support this behaviour. As a result, this can have devastating effects when you try to deploy the model or when you try to validate its accuracy. I am certain that the majority of people who face this believe they have overfitted the model while in reality this is just a side-effect of how Keras implements the Batch Normalization layer.\r\n\r\nSo let's test your example on my branch of Keras where the BN layer is patched:\r\n```\r\npip install -U --force-reinstall --no-dependencies git+https://github.com/datumbox/keras@bugfix/trainable_bn\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow I run your code for ResNet50. As you can see the problem that you report is fixed once the BN behaviour is changed:\r\n```\r\nEpoch 1/100\r\n50/50 [==============================] - 19s 387ms/step - loss: 0.8738 - acc: 0.5000 - val_loss: 1.3021 -

Nevertheless in this dummy example I try to reproduce a behaviour we've been facing for over a year now on real-world datasets and problems. In those cases a large number of different batch sizes were tested and the results were comparable.\r\n\r\nPlease note that his PR **DOES NOT** undo the recent change where the mean/var no longer shifts when trainable=False. I 100% agree with you that this change is very beneficial. This PR actually takes it a step further and makes sure that the moving mean/var are used instead of the mini-batch statistics when trainable=False. This ensures that the non-frozen layers will be trained on data scaled the same way as in inference mode.\r\n\r\nBTW thanks for sending me the discussion on #8616. Give me sometime to read all the details to see how this is related.\r\n\r\n\n@datumbox Ok think I see what you are saying, I might try this out on my dataset. Do I need to change any settings like trainable in my training code or can I just pull this in? In my example I use frozen vgg16 imagenet pretrained weights as a feature extractor with additional trainable layers afterwards.\r\n\r\nOne thing that might help with getting this through is a few improvements to the PR, variable names, and description. If you better separate the concepts and clarify the conditions under which different data is fixed vs changing the reasons this improves performance may be more obvious.\nOk so based on the [test_batchnorm_trainable() changes](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/9965/files#diff-267c0562b910ae677cf3ae65ea3b00a7R250) this should be active by default in all cases except when both `learning phase=1 and trainable=True`. \r\n\r\n```\r\n# In all other cases we should use the moving mean and variance from BN.\r\n```\r\nCorrect?\n@ahundt Thanks for looking into this. My PR affects only networks that use Batch Normalization layers, so VGG will not be affected. No additional configuration is required other than setting trainable=False on the BN layers. Pulling this in should work fine ~~just note that my fork is not synced with the latest stable version of Keras; I plan to do this soon as other people are interested~~. I synced the [patch on Keras 2.1.6](https://github.com/datumbox/keras/tree/fork/keras2.1.6), [Keras 2.2.2](https://github.com/datumbox/keras/tree/fork/keras2.2.2) and  [Keras 2.2.4](https://github.com/datumbox/keras/tree/fork/keras2.2.4).\r\n\r\n> One thing that might help with getting this through is a few improvements to the PR, variable names, and description. \r\n\r\nSure thing, send me your comments and I'll make the changes. :-)\r\n\nI think on the step 3, you meant to say \"all layers from (1) to trainable=**false** and from (2) to trainable=**True**\".\r\n\r\nThat can work but for a more profound effect you can also try fine-tuning a few layers from (1). In other words setting trainable=True to a few convolutions and Bns of (1) will do the trick. There is a great example on Keras documentation for fine-tuning [here](https://keras.io/applications/). This example fails immediately for any layer that uses BN.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing your results.\nI've tested this update ([Keras 2.1.6 fork](https://github.com/datumbox/keras/tree/fork/keras2.1.6) + TF 1.7 + CUDA 9 on a p3.2xlarge AWS instance) using the following architectures: `ResNet50`, `InceptionV3`, `InceptionResNetV2`, `Xception`, `DenseNet` and `NASNetLarge`. \r\n\r\nMy setup is similar to the \"[Fine-tune InceptionV3 on a new set of classes](https://keras.io/applications/#usage-examples-for-image-classification-models)\" example of the documentation. In all tests, I've used the pre-trained ImageNet weights of the framework and fine-tuned the networks on CIFAR10. The point to which I've frozen the pre-trained layers varies from network to network but in all cases, I've set `trainable=True` to at least 1 BatchNormalization and Convolution layer from the top of the base model. All other configurations (optimizer, batch-size, epochs etc) were kept the same across all executions. Using the fork, my accuracy improved by 3 to 6 points (depending on the architecture) comparing to the standard Keras. I've also noticed that on the fork the models converged faster and that between epochs the loss/accuracy deltas were \"smoother\". This is especially true for `ResNet50` and `InceptionV3` where the metrics of standard Keras jumped all over the place from one epoch to the next.\r\n\r\n@ahundt Did you have the chance to run the test on your data? Please let me know if you observed a similar effect.\r\n\r\n@fchollet I think it would be beneficial to extend Keras and allow BatchNormalization layers to run on Inference Mode after being initialized. One approach could be to have an `inference` property that the users can change after initialization. If you like that, let me know and I'd be happy to write it and send a pull request.\n@datumbox  After reading the related issues I am on your side.  \r\n\r\n@fchollet \r\n> Again, there is an existing API that does exactly what you want: the training argument in call. There is no point in having two differently name APIs that do the exact same thing. layer.trainable = False is not what you need, therefore don't use it.\r\n\r\nI partly agree with author but in the fine-tune document you should point this issue out. For any beginner of Keras, it will lead to some misunderstanding. \nI haven't abandoned this. \r\n\r\n> I think on the step 3, you meant to say \"all layers from (1) to trainable=false and from (2) to trainable=True\".\r\n\r\n@datumbox thanks for your correction, yes that was a typo.\r\n\r\nI've had hyperopt (~2k model variations for 1 epoch) running on a dataset to see if there is any movement. I have the numbers from the fork, but I'm waiting on the keras master run to finish for comparison. I might also do a third pair of runs where a random fraction of each network is trainable.\r\n\r\nAh so the two features we are discussing here are:\r\n\r\n- `Layer.__call__(training=True)`\r\n- `Layer.trainable = True` aka `Model.layers[i].trainable = True`\r\n\r\n\r\n\nOk I ran a hyperopt search on both master and this PR to compare. It is really set up for my research and not analyzing this PR so please forgive the glaring omissions of detail and the numerous ways this evaluation isn't perfect. :-)\r\n\r\nThere were 1143 models in two runs of a hyperparameter search with a fixed initial numpy seed, where all but ~30 configurations were random in two cases: master and pr 9965. The ~30 non random ones were chosen with Bayesian optimization on the hyperparameters via gpyopt. Examples of Hyperparams that changed included the model with pretrained imagenet weights: densenet, inception resnet v2, vgg, resnet, nasnet mobile, additional layers appended to the end as a resnet, densenet or vgg blocks, and a few other things. Training was for 1 epoch on each model with SGD and a learning rate of 0.02. It is a binary classification problem: success or failure of a robot to grasp an object. \r\n\r\nBe aware:\r\n- 1 epoch per model (sorry, I had 1 GPU to spare for this)\r\n- some of these models don't have batch norm at all\r\n- 50% of them will be completely trainable\r\n- 50% of them the imagenet weights will be completely locked\r\n\r\nHere are the averages and medians of the hyperparameter configurations with each keras version:\r\n\r\n **master:**\r\n\r\n\r\nalg | binary_accuracy | loss | lr | mean_pred | mean_true | test_binary_accuracy | test_loss | test_mean_pred | test_mean_true | val_binary_accuracy | val_loss\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nmean | 0.7047966469 | 1.2768393246 | 0.02 | 0.6532160745 | 0.6456679511 | 0.6923316583 | 1.5249089349 | 0.6347057594 | 0.6149205068 | 0.6680574575 | 1.6015010751\r\nmedian | 0.7218137255 | 0.6378628281 | 0.02 | 0.6444845796 | 0.6458333333 | 0.6767411301 | 0.642174027 | 0.6356934232 | 0.6149802891 | 0.660326087 | 0.6659815013\r\n\r\n**PR 9965:**\r\n\r\nalg | binary_accuracy | loss | lr | mean_pred | mean_true | test_binary_accuracy | test_loss | test_mean_pred | test_mean_true | val_binary_accuracy | val_loss | val_mean_pred\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nmean | 0.7032608824 | 1.3332693654 | 0.02 | 0.6535641914 | 0.6457873238 | 0.6922808729 | 1.5722599631 | 0.6542453542 | 0.6153116809 | 0.6663950069 | 1.6660901248 | 0.6577351063\r\nmedian | 0.7172947304 | 0.6426681823 | 0.02 | 0.6440287049 | 0.6459865196 | 0.673455979 | 0.6477609455 | 0.648474915 | 0.6149802891 | 0.6576086957 | 0.671154305 | 0.6532216195\r\n\r\nIn this case, it looks like the typical model performed the same or a fraction of a percentage worse. I looked at a few specific examples such as inception resnet v2 weights with training locked and either a densenet or resnet block on the end, and they might have done ~1-2% better, but they didn't suddenly become the best models found in the search because of this change.\r\n\r\nSo in other words what I ran was mostly inconclusive (and possibly misconfigured), because I forgot to try locking random fractions of the imagenet weights and so `trainable=True/False` was either on all imagenet weights or none. If you think it'd be worthwhile to re-run with random proportions I might be able to give it a try. Sorry for the delay and the imperfections, I figured it'd at least be best to provide an update.\r\n\r\nDespite this, multiple other people seem to be able to reproduce the benefits of this PR at least on cifar...\nFirst of all, thanks for all the effort trying to solve this problem. Also, I should say that I am new to Keras, but I have some experience with Tensorflow. \r\n\r\nLearning to work with the Applications module of Keras I bumped into this same issue. In the beginning, I thought I was overfitting, but when I tried to finetune VGG16 it did not overfit, so I started guessing that the problem could be the same as you are trying to fix.\r\n\r\nI created a simple example that fine tunes InceptionV3 to classify MNIST. \r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\n    '''\r\n    This code has been adapted from the mnist_cnn.py example of Keras\r\n    and from the Applications examples on the Keras webpage\r\n    '''\r\n    from __future__ import print_function, division\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import keras\r\n    from keras.applications.inception_v3 import InceptionV3\r\n    from keras.models import Model, load_model\r\n    from keras.layers import Input\r\n    from keras.layers import Dropout\r\n    from keras.layers import Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D\r\n    from keras import backend as K\r\n    from keras.datasets import mnist\r\n    import cv2\r\n\r\n\r\n    def load_mnist_dataset(num_train=None, num_test=None):\r\n        '''from keras mnist example\r\n        '''\r\n        #

I checked the suggested solution but I still feel this does not cover all cases. Here are the two main points that in my opinion remain not addressed:\r\n\r\n1. Setting the BNs to trainable and resetting their statistics is not a good solution because the next convolution weights (which remain with trainable=False) were estimated using the initial BN statistics. Resetting their numbers will adapt them to the distribution of the new data but as I describe on the blog post the next convolutions and non-linearities will never get to adapt in this change because they are frozen. This can have very bad effects especially if the new BN stats cause the output to become positive (from negative) as it will affect the next RELUs. Also since the default momentum on BNs can't be changed after their definition, you will require a large number of iterations to adapt the moving mean/var of the BNs.\r\n2. The problem does not only appear on the pretrained models included in the applications, but also when you load any other pretrained model stored on disk. Imagine that you might have trained a classifier from scratch on one domain and now you want to use it as initial weights on a different problem. Just updating the applications API will not fix the problem as most likely you need to apply the same patch on load_model().\r\n\r\nRecently there was an interesting discussion on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1006880874145517569?s=19) and other people have pointed out this problem in the past and not all Deep Learning Frameworks are affected. At any case I think it is clear that the documentation is very misleading and as you said needs to be updated. Personally I think that there is no reason to scale differently the data when a BN layer is frozen. There is no theoretical or mathematical justification on why such a different rescaling policy takes place when the layer is frozen. At any case I hope someone will patch this on the future as the effects of the problem are likely to affect lots of people and they might not be aware as it has similar symptoms as overfitting.\r\n\nI think this all still indicates there is an issue: the keras API could be more clear and easy to use when fine tuning, with an explicit and easy to use choice between the options mentioned by @ppwwyyxx (plus perhaps Group Normalization).  Anyone have time to design one?\r\n\r\n@ppwwyyxx are there any publicly available pretrained weights with group normalization? \r\n\r\nI believe typical users won't have the resources to train ImageNet weights from scratch. [GroupNorm is currently only a pull request in keras-contrib](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib/pull/243), and not in keras.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you're fairly certain that GroupNorm will work better for most use cases, you made a pretty strong statement. :-)\nI believe Keras used to have a parameter called `mode` for Batch Normalization. At that time, `mode` acted as a flag to dictate whether BN was used in inference more or training mode (and this specific functionality is now performed by using the `training` argument in BN's `call` method. During the migration from Keras 1 to 2, this argument was dropped. \r\n\r\n@fchollet If `mode` can be re-implemented, this time taking into account the above cases, with clear and precise documentation of how each mode behaves, then it can alleviate this fine tuning issue fairly easily. In that case, we can either drop the `training` argument altogether or for backward compatibility, use it to dictate a mode of operation (the default mode when True, and one of the other modes when set to False).\r\n\r\nAs to performance, the current BN operation can be the default mode, and the documentation explicitly state that the other modes will incur more cost at training/evaluation time as necessary. Using the `mode` argument, the computation graph can be built such that it will cost less in terms of switch statements that have to be made by the backend, however some will be unavoidable. ",
    "sumarized_length": 1135,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment raises significant concerns regarding the misuse of the \"trainable\" property in layer definitions, which impacts the intended behavior of batch normalization (BN) during inference and training. The current implementation leads to inefficiencies and performance degradation, notably a potential ~5% slowdown due to computational overhead when using BN layers. The reviewer suggests utilizing the existing `training` argument in the `call` method to control layer behavior, emphasizing that `layer.trainable = False` does not fulfill the specific requirements for fine-tuning. \n\nAdditionally, there are complications with the learning phase setting that could inadvertently affect model training dynamics, particularly for pre-trained models. The reviewer also highlights a lack of proper semantics in the API and advocates for an adjustable BN layer inference option post-initialization to ensure consistent scaling. The patch's effectiveness is supported by user tests showing improved accuracy without extensive retraining. This realization underscores the need for clearer documentation on handling BN layers in Keras."

    "unsumarized_comments": "> We already support fitting from tensors / TFRecords. Please make a case for this PR.\r\n\r\n@fchollet Is there a TFRecords example with the `model.fit()` API somewhere that I missed? Perhaps I also misunderstood the API usage, my notes below assume changes are needed to support TFRecords.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- TFRecords example\r\n- Several small changes needed so the example does not crash\r\n- Users can pass additional ops and a feed dict to `session.run()` via `model.fit()` \r\n\r\n### Why modify model.fit() to accept TFRecords instead of writing my own training loop? \r\n- The Keras API design is excellent so I'd prefer to reuse it\r\n- Avoid maintaining a fork and compatibility as keras evolves\r\n- Use other libraries built on keras\r\n- Minimize the effort to switch backends in user code subsets that don't depend on TFRecords. \r\n- I know of ~6 others that have searched or asked about this functionality. I hope this will help them too. :-)\r\n\r\nI can implement things in a different manner as needed. I can also split this into several smaller pull requests according to the headline changes below.\r\n\r\n### model.fit(x=None, y=None) \r\n\r\nIn several places `model.fit()` [assumed that either x or y is not None](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-299cfd5886683a4b012f286403769fc1L1322), which isn't the case if the data is supplied by a Tensor op.\r\n\r\n### Disabling sample weights\r\n\r\nSample_weights in `model.fit()` assumes `x is not None and y is not None` in many places. Additionally, when a tensor supplies the samples, I don't think the information necessary to initialize the right number, dimension, and values of sample weight placeholders is available to this part of the code.\r\n\r\nI chose the `disabled` parameter for backwards compatibility, but I know that naming scheme doesn't fit with the rest of the API.\r\n\r\n### [is_placeholder()](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-c66ff60af92d5eee116b055bbb711174R111)\r\n\r\nI use is_placeholder() to [differentiate numpy inputs from tensorflow op inputs](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-fe3ca734e8421a17729d0b0ea4c800baR1624), which allows [`y_true` and `y_pred` to be correctly assigned to the appropriate tf op](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-299cfd5886683a4b012f286403769fc1R915), without this change the program crashes by trying to [incorrectly pass an op to K.placeholder](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-299cfd5886683a4b012f286403769fc1R896).\r\n\r\n`is_placeholder` can also be useful when enumerating the layers, inputs, outputs, and transforming an arbitrary model. For example anything that walks the graph may or may not want to modify placeholders, such as an automated labeling model to segmentation model converter.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `is_placeholder` was based on [_uses_learning_phase and _keras_shape](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-ff634bb5c5441d7052449f20018872b8R223).\r\n\r\n### TFRecords Example\r\n\r\nThere is quite a bit of interest in training models from TFRecords, with a bunch of comments + thumbs in the [keras-contrib PR](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/keras-contrib/pull/27) and [tensorflow issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8787). Loading from TFRecords will certainly be faster than from disk, and is suggested in the [high performance models docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_models). The dataset I'm using was released as a TFRecord, so it is quite convenient.\r\n\r\nI didn't really like this workaround:\r\n```python\r\nModel(inputs=[x_train_input, y_train_in_out], outputs=[x_train_out, y_train_in_out])\r\n```\r\nIs there a better way to supply label values from a TFRecord?\r\n\r\n### class Function(fetches, feed_dict)\r\n\r\nBefore this change, auxiliary tf tensor data & operations could *almost* be provided to the `session.run()` call, but not quite since the [feed_dict and fetches params end up duplicated](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-a18b8c6a1191d6f49303e0d599ca8c37L2268). The return path of the [`updated`](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-a18b8c6a1191d6f49303e0d599ca8c37R2280) variable might still need some tweaking. Why might this be useful? API & algorithm extensions that need to be fast can be added without modifying Keras models or training functions.\r\n\r\nMy motivating API extension example is training on a realtime data source like a robot. I want to supply live images via an op while actively fitting, and log the image via another op. There is no need for the logging op to affect my model/training but the source/sink should run in the same session, and the overhead of moving the images to numpy arrays and serializing would cause frames to drop. \r\n\nSo currently you are supposed to be able to:\r\n- build models on top of tensors\r\n- train with `fit` with partial Numpy data (i.e. any tensor input will no expect Numpy data), e.g. `fit(x=None, y)`\r\n\r\nWhat changes?\n> What changes?\r\n\r\nHere are the changes, marked with `==bugfix==` or `==new param==` in the comments below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# tf ops that supply dataset images and labels\r\nx_train_batch, y_train_batch = read_and_decode_recordinput(...)\r\n\r\n# create a basic mlp\r\nx_train_input = Input(tensor=x_train_batch)\r\nx_train_out = cnn_layers(x_train_input)\r\n\r\n# y label batch is input & output\r\ny_train_in_out = Input(tensor=y_train_batch)\r\n\r\n# ==bugfix== \r\n# these lines cause a crash without the patch\r\n# because an invalid call equivalent to this is made:\r\n# K.placeholder(dtype=x_train_input)\r\ntrain_model = Model(inputs=[x_train_input, y_train_in_out],\r\n                    outputs=[x_train_out, y_train_in_out])\r\n\r\n# ==new param option==\r\n# model.compile(sample_weight_mode='disabled')\r\n\r\n# ==bugfix==\r\n# This call will crash without the patch,\r\n# even if sample_weight_mode=None.\r\ntrain_model.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',\r\n                    loss='categorical_crossentropy',\r\n                    metrics=['accuracy'],\r\n                    sample_weight_mode='disabled')\r\n\r\n# ==new param==\r\n# sess.run(fetches, feed_dict) parameters handled correctly in backend\r\nhello = tf.constant('Hello, TensorFlow!')\r\ntrain_model.fit(batch_size=batch_size, epochs=300, fetches=hello)\r\n```\n > If sample weighting cannot be supported, then it should be disabled automatically and a ValueError should be raised if the user attempt to pass some sample weights. This should not be handled by the user via sample_weight_mode='disabled'\r\n\r\nGreat idea, why didn't I think of that? Thanks!\r\n\r\n>> read_and_decode_recordinput\r\n>\r\n> What does it do exactly and why is it necessary?\r\n\r\nIt is not part of the API, it is user code creating the tf ops that feed data in mnist_tensorflow.py, [read_and_decode_recordinput()](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928/files#diff-5d4b217f28eee8c68337324ed48f12adR97). I'll explain in more detail in the datasets pull request, because it is most relevant there.\r\n\r\n>> fetches\r\n>\r\n> Can you explain the fetches API in further detail?\r\n\r\nYou may slap your head when you read this one, but no worries I'm happy to clarify! :-)\r\n\r\n`fetches` is the first parameter of [tf.session.run()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session#run)\r\n\r\n```\r\nrun(\r\n    fetches,\r\n    feed_dict=None,\r\n    options=None,\r\n    run_metadata=None\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\n> how are users supposed to understand its usage? How would you write docs about it?\r\n\r\nWhat is does is forwards `fetches` and `feed_dict` to `session.run()`.\r\n\r\nHere are some first pass doc lines:\r\n```python\r\nhistory = model.fit(fetches,feed_dict)\r\n\"\"\"\r\n# Arguments\r\n\r\n    fetches: TensorFlow backend only.

When provided,\r\n        additional tensor values are returned:\r\n            `history, tensors = model.fit(fetches,feed_dict)`\r\n        See https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session for more details\r\n        on this parameter.\r\n    feed_dict: TensorFlow backend only.

Details are in my previous post https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/6928#issuecomment-307593457.\nHmm, `mnist_tfrecord.py` doesn't actually train, the output is no better than chance. Does anyone see the source of the disconnect? Perhaps the labels aren't actually being used in the loss function?\n@fchollet @Dref360 In addition to the existing tf.Variable support, generating tensors are now supported, tests are added, and a NotImplementedError is thrown in the generating tensors + sample_weights case for which there isn't yet support.

If you are going to use `fit(None, None)`, which semantically doesn't make a lot of sense, it may be preferable not to use `fit` at all: for instance, TF Estimators provide a training loop that you can use with Keras models that use symbolic tensors for both inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another API that could be interesting to have in the future would be:\r\n- build model with placeholders (usual process, using `Input` and regular `compile`)\r\n- call `fit(x, y)` with `x` and `y` being symbolic tensors\r\n\r\nThis is no ad-hoc, and is semantically meaningful and consistent with the rest of the API.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are various technical complications with this approach, which is why we haven't done it yet:\r\n- specifying epochs is no longer relevant, it should be steps instead\r\n- it requires rewiring the graph by replacing the placeholders with tensors. This is not technically possible at this point, at least not without loss of performance.\r\n\r\nI hope that in the future, changes in TF will allow us to implement this. In the meantime, I don't think we should add this `labels` argument.\r\n\n@fchollet I've got alternatives, please consider them before we toss out the functionality wholesale!\r\n\r\n*Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,\r\nTo mar the subject that before was well?\r\n-William Shakespeare*\r\n\r\nThere are three three types of data interface point any model must manage:\r\n\r\n1. `inputs`\r\n2. `outputs`\r\n3. `targets` (aka `labels`)\r\n\r\nThere is a mechanism to define the interface of the first two at `Model` construction `Model(inputs,outputs)`, we just need a good way to define the `targets` a model should expect. \r\n\r\nCurrently the `target` is really determined in `Model.compile()`: \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef compile()\r\n        # ...snip..\r\n        # Prepare targets of model.\r\n        # ...snip...\r\n        ### Need the right kind of target definition here ###\r\n        if self.labels[i] is None:\r\n            target = K.placeholder(ndim=len(shape),...)\r\n            # ...snip...\r\n        else:\r\n            ### Under Consideration ###\r\n            # user specified target here\r\n            target = # ?\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Here are some straightforward options:**\r\n\r\n1. Rename `labels` to `targets` or `expect_targets`, or another name that implies an interface definition, not actual data (all options below can also be renamed).\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntrain_model = Model(inputs=[x_train_input],\r\n                    outputs=[x_train_out],\r\n                    expect_targets=[y_train_in_out])\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create an optional `Target` Layer, that can hold a target parameter. **Advantage: no external API changes!**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx_in = Input()\r\nx = Dense(256, activation='softmax`)(x)\r\nx_out = Target(y_train_in_out)(x)\r\nModel(inputs=x_in, outputs=x_out)\r\n```\r\n3. Add an optional `target` parameter to `Layer`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx_in = Input()\r\nx_out = Dense(256, activation='softmax`, target=y_train_in_out)(x)\r\nModel(inputs=x_in, outputs=x_out)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Create a small `Compile` object internal to Model, which lets compile be delayed until ops can be provided to `fit()`, `predict()`, or whichever one is actually used.\r\n\r\n5. Add a separate member function for configuring custom targets.\r\n\r\n6. Clearly mark the API/parameter as experimental and subject to change until a lazy op is created (applies to all options).\r\n\r\nCould any of these work?\nCurrently, placeholders are created automatically for model outputs that expect targets. Your proposed mechanisms are a way to override that by specifying target tensors manually.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't understand why it would be useful to override this mechanism. If you don't need it, you have the option *not to use it*: pass `None` as loss for an output, and then no placeholder will be created and no target data will be expected.\r\n\r\nIn this setup, any symbolic data tensor that goes in goes through an `Input` layer (or it could just be injected via any `Lambda` layer or custom layer), and any extra losses that should be computed are added via `add_loss`. I don't see any limitations to the current setup.\r\n\r\n> Create an optional Target Layer, that can hold a target parameter. Advantage: no external API changes!\r\n\r\nCan you detail what it would do?\r\n\nMaking this clear with an example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx_in = Input(...)\r\nx_out = Dense(256, activation='softmax`)(x_in)\r\nmodel = Model(inputs=x_in, outputs=x_out)\r\nloss = loss_fn(targets, x_out)\r\nmodel.add_loss(loss_fn)\r\n\r\n# The part below is semantically ugly and reflects the fact that\r\n# it would probably be better to `fit` with something else than\r\n# the build-in loop\r\nmodel.compile(optimizer=None, loss=None)\r\nmodel.fit(None, None)\r\n```\n> > Create an optional Target Layer, that can hold a target parameter. Advantage: no external API changes!\r\n>\r\n> Can you detail what it would do?\r\n\r\nSure! It leverages the fact that for every output there must be a target. The `Layer` aspect of it will behave like `Dropout(0)`, i.e. do nothing.\r\n\r\n**Usage example from [mnist_tfrecord_target_layer.py line 173](https://gist.github.com/ahundt/0d22dd7c883300e45726077c9d6b352a#file-mnist_tfrecord_target_layer-py-L173):**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx_train_input = Input(tensor=x_train_batch, batch_shape=x_batch_shape)\r\nx_train_out = cnn_layers(x_train_input)\r\n\r\n# Target created\r\nx_target_out = Target(y_train_batch)(x_train_out)\r\ntrain_model = Model(inputs=[x_train_input], outputs=[x_target_out])\r\n\r\n# key code is in compile(), see the next snippet \r\ntrain_model.compile(\r\n    optimizer='rmsprop',\r\n    loss='categorical_crossentropy',\r\n    metrics=['accuracy'])\r\n\r\ntensorboard = TensorBoard(write_graph=True)\r\ntrain_model.fit(batch_size=batch_size,\r\n                epochs=epochs,\r\n                callbacks=[tensorboard])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Implementation pseudocode:**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# Target Layer API pseudocode\r\nclass Target(Layer)\r\n    def __init__(target, **kwargs)\r\n        # call super, etc\r\n        self.target=target\r\n\r\n    def get_target()\r\n        return self.target\r\n\r\n# Model.compile\r\nclass Model(Container):\r\n    def compile()\r\n        # ...snip...\r\n        # Prepare targets of model.\r\n        self.targets = []\r\n        self._feed_targets = []\r\n        for i in range(len(self.outputs)):\r\n            if i in skip_indices:\r\n                self.targets.append(None)\r\n            else:\r\n                shape = self.internal_output_shapes[i]\r\n                name = self.output_names[i]\r\n\r\n                ### Target provides the user specified target definition here ###\r\n                if isinstance(self.outputs[i], Target):\r\n                    target = self.outputs[i].get_target()\r\n                else:\r\n                    target = K.placeholder(ndim=len(shape),\r\n                                           name=name + '_target',\r\n                                           sparse=K.is_sparse(self.outputs[i]),\r\n                                           dtype=K.dtype(self.outputs[i]))\r\n                self.targets.append(target)\r\n                self._feed_targets.append(target)\r\n        # ...snip...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: There might be typos above, I checked it carefully but it isn't fully implemented yet.\r\n\r\n## Why it is useful to override the placeholder mechanism\r\n\r\n> However, I don't understand why it would be useful to override this mechanism.

In short, it will force target = tf.placeholder(...) to be passed to a feed_dict as this simplified code illustrates:\r\n\r\nYes, you can't feed a placeholder with a tensor. In the future, it may be possible to rewire the graph to replace the placeholder with the tensor, though. But that's beyond the point.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that \"having a target placeholder for every output\" is optional as of Keras 2, not a requirement. If you don't want a placeholder for a certain output, then you pass `None` as the loss for this output, and you are done.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to use data tensors (yield ops) for both inputs and targets in a Keras model while still having access to `fit` / etc.\r\n\r\nCF this code example (in theory it should work and we do have a unit test to this extent; if you think it doesn't, that would be a bug, so please point out why):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx_in, targets = get_some_data_tensors_from_tfrecords(...)\r\nx_in = Input(tensor=x_in)\r\nx_out = Dense(256, activation='softmax`)(x_in)\r\nmodel = Model(inputs=x_in, outputs=x_out)\r\nloss = loss_fn(targets, x_out)\r\nmodel.add_loss(loss_fn)\r\n\r\n# The part below is semantically ugly and reflects the fact that\r\n# it would probably be better to `fit` with something else than\r\n# the build-in loop\r\nmodel.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss=None)\r\nmodel.fit(None, None)\r\n# at this point, the output will *not* be part of feed_dict\r\n# (in fact feed_dict is empty in this example)\r\n```\nYesterday I created https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/10837 to keep track of replacing placeholders with a tensor, but I now get that I should use the workaround and take a wait and see approach as tensorflower-gardener does its gardening. 👍\r\n\r\nConsidering your comments, how about the following steps? \r\n\r\n1. I'll focus on https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/7046 which drops `Model()` API changes, but includes `is_placeholder()` and the internal fixes.\r\n    - Dref360 checked the equivalents here in #6928, but https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/7046 needs another touch-up review\r\n2. Regarding the `yield_op` workaround you just described\r\n    1. I noticed bugs, I'll put tests in #7061. Would you prefer them on master or with #7030 applied?\r\n    2. The `loss=None` workaround behavior was very surprising, would you accept a separate Target layer PR with clear temporary/experimental notifications? I suspect it might also fix the aforementioned bugs. TF 1.3 will be a couple months.\n> I'll focus on #7030 which drops Model() API changes, but includes is_placeholder() and the internal fixes.\r\n\r\nAssuming that you mean #7046: it looks very large, with several different things going on. It would be helpful if you could break it down into smaller, more atomic PRs.\r\n\r\n> I noticed bugs, I'll put tests in a separate PR. Would you prefer them on master\r\n\r\nA separate PR for fixing bugs would be preferable. You could start it by adding a failing unit test, for instance.\r\n\r\n> The loss=None workaround behavior was very surprising, would you accept a separate Target layer PR with clear temporary/experimental notifications? I suspect it might also fix the aforementioned bugs. TF 1.3 will be a couple months.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is necessary. The `loss=None` workaround is no more surprising than any other mechanism (e.g. `Target`). It's not a good UX, but here's the thing: it's not something that is meant to be used except in edge cases. If your data does not come from a placeholder, or if your training does not follow the \"one loss/target per output\" assumption, then you would probably be better off using a TensorFlow-specific training loop, like Estimator. In that case Keras would just act as a topological engine for building models.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: it's okay to have relatively non-obvious APIs for edge cases that are only going to be used by a niche of users. It is more important to have intuitive APIs for common use cases. Also: doing everything in vanilla Keras if you have a specialized TF workflow might not be optimal.",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment raises several concrete technical concerns about modifying the `model.fit()` API to support TensorFlow Records (TFRecords). Key issues highlighted include:\n\n1. **API Compatibility**: The current design of `model.fit()` intrinsically assumes that either `x` or `y` is not `None`, complicating implementation when using tensors fed directly from ops. A revision is necessary to handle cases where data from TensorFlow ops replaces the need for numpy input.\n\n2. **Sample Weights Management**: Without adjusting the sample weights handling, passing tensors results in crashes, as the code incorrectly assumes valid sample weight placeholders are present. A proposed solution is to automatically disable or raise an exception when sample weights are included with non-conforming inputs.\n\n3. **Use of `is_placeholder()`**: The implementation of `is_placeholder()` is critical in distinguishing between numpy and TensorFlow tensor inputs, preventing crashes caused by incorrect data type assignments.\n\n4. **TFRecords Implementation Example**: There is a call for concrete examples showcasing TFRecords within the model.fit() context, as existing documentation appears insufficient.\n\n5. **Concerns with 'labels' Parameter**: The addition of a `labels` argument for handling expected target tensors was met with skepticism, suggesting a more structured approach could be explored.\n\n6. **Testing and Validation**: A focus on modular PRs to isolate functionalities has been recommended to ensure streamlined testing and maintainability moving forward."

The only place left which doesn't strictly adhere to this are the private functions that build the model (generally the code is inlined in the method, here I have used a few different methods).\r\n\r\nI agree that these models need a lot of extra code, such as the DepthwiseConv2D layer, additional backend function, relu6 activation and the corresponding tests.\nI think relu6 should just be defined locally in the application file, or it should be generalized unless 6 is a fundamentally better max for many wide use cases. Plus, I think it is possible to pass relu6 as a param to the Activation, it doesn't need to be a string. \r\n\r\nI've been keeping an eye on this and overall the code structure/syntax looks fine to me but unfortunately I can't say I've carefully compared this to the paper...\n@ahundt If you mean relu6 should be local to the file in the following manner : \r\n```\r\nimport keras.activations\r\n\r\ndef relu6(x):\r\n    return K.relu(x, max_value=6)\r\n\r\nkeras.activations.relu6 = relu6\r\n... \r\nx = Activation('relu6', ...)(x)\r\n```\r\nYes, the above works.\r\n\r\nHowever, using a lambda to wrap relu with max_value parameter does not work. It will not deserialize correctly with load_model. Unfortunately, I have found no way of passing arbitrary arguments to Activation layer (so that it can defer them to the actual activation function). It also makes very little sense to do so, given that `relu` is the only activation function that has additional arguments to it's signature (considering non-advanced activations only, `elu` has its corresponding `ELU` layer to use its argument).\r\n\r\nI added `relu6` to Keras, because Tensorflow has a specific activation function called `relu6` [(tf.nn.relu6)](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/relu6). Since its inclusion will not affect the Theano or CNTK backends, it made more sense to me to incorporate it into the activations file and be in line with the Tensorflow API. If @fchollet decides that the above mentioned fix is sufficient for this purpose, I will roll back this change.\r\n\r\nAs to comparison with the paper, the model is correct in its implementation. The tensorflow graphs match exactly. Further proof is that the tensorflow provided weights, upon translation to Keras, provide exactly same predictions as Tensorflow with same accuracy.\n> the above works\r\n\r\nI'd recommend doing that.\r\n\r\n> I added relu6 to Keras, because Tensorflow has a specific activation function called relu6\r\n\r\nA legacy of patterns used in early DL models at Google. Including it in TF was a mistake IMO. It's Google's technical debt. No need to burden the Keras API with it.\n@fchollet I agree with your assessment. \r\n\r\nI had to make a few alterations to `__init__.py` of the applications folder to expose the `DepthwiseConv2D` / `DepthwiseConvolution2D` layers and `relu6` activation. Also, the convolution tests must now import DepthwiseConv2D from `keras.applications.mobilenet` rather than `keras.layers`, but other than that no major modifications.\r\n\r\nThe other corrections have been applied as suggested.\n@fchollet Seems tests fail because their is a deserialization test in the `layer_test` which cannot deserialize the layer from config, if it has custom objects. \r\n\r\n`recovered_model = Model.from_config(model_config)` (Line 100 in test_utils.py) does have an argument to accept custom objects, but the `layer_test` does not have an argument to pass the custom object to that section of the test.\r\n\r\nI can modify the layer_test to take an optional argument `custom_objects=None` at the end of the argument list, and then pass that to the respective lines (the cleanest solution I can think of, and I would prefer this if allowed).\r\n\r\nIf not that, I would have to drop the tests for the layer (a last resort option).\nYou can use a custom object scope to avoid having to pass around custom objects: https://keras.io/utils/#customobjectscope\nJust ran the Keras model and the checkpoint on the same image. Both are giving the exact same results. \r\nHere is a gist to execute the keras (master version with above mentioned fix) and the tensorflow checkpoint: https://gist.github.com/titu1994/c110987f5ac6a0f1e3b64320764b1f40\r\n\r\nI assume giraffe gave wrong results since ImageNet doesn't seem to have giraffes as a class -

    "sumarized_length": 894,
    "summarized_comments": "The build errors are attributed to TimeDistributed issues in CNTK and Theano, as well as a pip install error for Integration Tests. It has been noted that the model and other related tests are passing, yet tests continue to fail due to TensorFlow download issues. There is concern regarding the `relu6` implementation; it should either be defined locally or generalized unless justified by its broader applicability. Using a lambda for `relu` with a `max_value` parameter is not viable as it fails deserialization with `load_model`. Custom objects are required for layer deserialization in tests, and a modification of the `layer_test` function to accept `custom_objects` as an optional argument is suggested. This approach is preferred over dropping the tests. Overall, the code structure has been deemed acceptable, but close adherence to established Keras documentation should be maintained."

    "summarized_comments": "This PR commentary raises several concrete technical concerns regarding model training, API integration, and build procedures in Keras. A key issue is the accuracy discrepancy observed while training four RegNetY variants, which were 2-3% lower than the original paper, despite improved optimizers. Specific performance metrics highlight these gaps. Additionally, the author reports facing a proto import error while building Keras from source, indicating potential issues with the local Keras workspace conflicting with the pip-installed version. Recommendations suggest verifying exports in `keras/api/_v2/keras/applications/__init__.py` and updating the `api_init_files.bzl` to include new APIs. An update on the training approach reveals successful validation accuracy within 2% of the paper for the RegNetX002 model, noting experimentation with hyperparameters and preprocessing methods. The use of EMA weights led to divergence issues, warranting a return to standard practices."

I want to have test suite for each keras operation where it creates one layer model and test inference results. As reference, we can use numpy backend's results, for example. This way we will add more op coverage support step-by-step and validate new functionality. How do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRoman\n> Sorry, only seeing this now. It looks better! It seems the set of ops currently implemented is quite small, however. What kinds of end-to-end workflows are currently working? What level of op coverage do you think you can achieve?\r\n\r\nHi @fchollet, currently we support `predict` method only for inference. `evaluate` is not supported because it requires to support loss function and run it on the same backend. That is not convenient to do with our backend because eager execution is absent.\r\n\r\nIn future, from my quick glance we will be able to cover solid number of operations because OpenVINO opset is quite well developed and support a lot of TF, PyTorch, ONNX models from different hubs (TF, ONNX, HF, PyTorch, etc,) for inference and we permanently develop it to cover TF, PyTorch, ONNX opsets.

So we will have the base OpenVINO support here and continue ops coverage support in future PRs. For the base OpenVINO support, I propose to support operations required by BERT model without preprocessor from Keras Hub, for example, and demonstrate that it works. Example below.

So I want OV backend to be on trend and tested against fresh tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to solve these problems, I propose to re-use existing pytest tests from keras directory and step-by-step switch them on while we are adding new operations support. I managed to re-use multiple such tests as you can see the current state of PR.\r\nWhat we can do:\r\n1. for openvino backend, extend a list of ignore test files (https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/.github/workflows/actions.yml#L89). It will have a custom list of files that we will reduced step-by-step. In addition, inside the test file we can use `skipif` if there are a few tests failing. So we will use combination of ignore file list and `skipif`.\r\nI think the most convenient and reliable way for backend development is usage of such generic tests. @fchollet, how do you think and will you allow to proceed with this way instead of OV specific integration tests (concepts of such tests is quite unclear and weak).\r\n\r\nMoreover, pytest tests are successfully switch on for numpy backend. And of course, our one of goal is to reach parity with numpy backend in terms of functionality.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nRoman\n> for openvino backend, extend a list of ignore test files \r\n\r\nSounds good -- so the changes would be limited to an OpenVino specific config file that lists the test files to exclude?\n> Sounds good -- so the changes would be limited to an OpenVino specific config file that lists the test files to exclude?\r\n\r\nYes, I will try to create openvino specific config file with a list of excluded test files.\r\n",
    "sumarized_length": 1036,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR presents a substantial shift toward OpenVINO backend support, emphasizing the need for dedicated integration tests to validate inference results across Keras operations. Specific concerns raised include the limited current operation set and the absence of a `evaluate` method due to challenges with backend loss function execution. The proposed approach involves incremental coverage of operations, starting with the `BertClassifier` and extending to `MobileNetV3`, with references drawn from existing backend implementations. Security and architectural considerations arise from the design of tests, where conventional pytest tests — rather than OpenVINO-specific ones — should be leveraged to ensure functionality aligns with the numpy backend. This strategy allows for gradual adaptation as new operations are integrated. Additionally, a config file will be created to manage test exclusions effectively. This way, the focus on operational parity with existing backends remains intact while maintaining flexibility in testing."

I need to add the broadcast for the multiply in `_step` to get them to the same shape.\n\n> Any way this hypothesis can be tested?\n\nI altered the batch size and it went away, I think it's just the cost of CPU->GPU transfer\n\n> Also: please use spaces after commas and around arithmetic signs for code readability.\n\nOn it :)\n\nWaait I just realized a fundamental problem with this approach. Now we have the `SimpleRNN` output 0 for every masked value, so the mask doesn't propagate down multiple layers.\n\nI need to have it instead output the mask, but then I _also_ need to check h_tm1 to see if it's masked. Hmm.\n\nWell if I change the output of each SimpleRNN to be [-999] when masked, then that propagates properly down to the next layer of the deep net.\n\nHowever, when I get an _unmasked_ value , say at `t=3` it will incorporate in its step the value from `t=2`, which, since it was masked, is `[-999]`, not 0.\n\nI could pass in mask_tm1 as another variable to `step`, and then do\n\n```\n mask_t * self.activation(x_t + mask_tm1*T.dot(h_tm1, u))\n```\n\nthat would fix it, at the cost of a bit more memory.\n\nI believe this series of cascading issues could be avoided by reverting to the initial plan of a hard-coded mask value of 0., non configurable. Pros/cons? \n\n> but I'd be worried about the performance impact\n\nIs the performance impact going to be different for a 0. mask? I still need to explicitly check if it's all 0 because the value that gets sent in to `_step` is not `X` but rather something like `W*X + b` so if X is all 0, you end up with `b` passed in to `_step`, which is not the mask_val.\n\nOK some updates: I've introduced masking to `SimpleDeepRNN` to show that the same approach works. As part of this I realized a better design for passing the mask, using the `taps` of scan.\n\nIncidentally this also fixes a bug where you couldn't set `depth=1` in the `SimpleDeepRNN`\n\nOK another change: I realized that it makes more sense to have _step _apply_ a mask, but\nthen to set the masked entries to mask_value outside of step. This\nshould be more efficient, but more importantly should make\nimplementations easier to understand.\n\nAnother nice effect: an alternative masking scheme can be introduced\nwithout changing _step at all. I think you'll agree that this makes the _step functions very simple.\n\nBy the way: I'm still investigating some problems, this works well on my artificial test examples, but is currently failing on my actual application if I set `zero_is_mask=True` and pass in partially masked data. I don't know what the issue is yet so don't merge!\n\n> I don't know what the issue is yet so don't merge!\n\nFor merging I'll wait for everything to be tested; also it would be preferable to add masking to all recurrent layers at once : )\n\n> I think masking will also need to be supported by TimeDistributedDense layers, incase someone builds an architecture that stacks them atop RNN layers. Thoughts?\n\nAbsolutely, that would be necessary. Or, we can by-pass the issue by using 0 as the default masking value (and offsetting our ReLUs by epsilon). \n\nStill, I believe anything in Keras that processes sequences should support masking. Including `TimeDistributedDense` and `time_distributed_softmax`.\n\n> Absolutely, that would be necessary. Or, we can by-pass the issue by using 0 as the default masking value (and offsetting our ReLUs by epsilon).\n\nThis won't bypass the issue. `TimeDistributedDense` includes a bias term so passing in 0 entries does not give 0 entries at the output.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR showcases several technical concerns and suggestions regarding the implementation of masking in recurrent neural networks. \n\nFirstly, the use of broadcasting in `mask = T.addbroadcast(mask[:,:,np.newaxis], 2)` needs clarification, as it's crucial for aligning the dimensions of the mask and data tensors for multiplication in `_step`. It was observed that test durations on GPU differ from CPU machines, possibly indicating a performance issue that should be tested further.\n\nA critical architectural concern arises with the mask causing `SimpleRNN` to output zeros for masked values, leading to poor propagation in subsequent layers. It was proposed to output a fixed mask value (e.g., `[-999]`) to address this, but it may lead to inaccurate incorporation of previous states if masked.\n\nThe introduction of masking in `SimpleDeepRNN` demonstrates the possibility of improved design using `taps` of scan, which also resolves an issue with `depth=1`. The suggestion to apply the mask outside of `_step` enhances efficiency and simplifies implementation. \n\nFurthermore, there's a necessity to ensure that masking supports `TimeDistributedDense` layers, as passing zeros could lead to incorrect outputs due to bias terms. The default mask value, suggested as zero offset by epsilon, does not solve all masking complications. The suggestion to delay merging until all components are tested is imperative."

    "unsumarized_comments": "could you include a before/after screenshot since this changes what tensorboard does?\r\n\r\n`validation_data_size` definitely needs more details though. Is it the size of all validation data? What happens in a case with `steps` where that may be ambiguous?\nExactly, the `validation_data_size` refers to the number of samples in the validation data. This is needed to create the `tf.Variable` to hold the `embedding`s to ultimately visualize each validation-data sample at the output of the embedding layer. Before, each weight at the \"embedding\" layer was visualized (see \"before\"-screenshot above), which doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nHaven't come across `steps` yet, so I'm not sure about that case. I can say, though, we definitely need to know the number of samples in the validation data if we want to visualize their embedding at a given layer.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to find out the number of samples in the `validation_data` when using `steps`?\nThanks a lot @dschwertfeger for this PR. I can confirm the need for this and with minor changes (see below) it works for my purposes. Things I noticed:\r\n* In principle, the `validation_data_size` could be inferred from the callback's `validation_data`, however   the latter is only set after `set_model` needs it. This and how to deal with the `steps` case, seems related, but unfortunately I didn't have the time to dig deeper so far.\r\n* within `on_epoch_end`:\r\n      * The learning phase is not set, but needed to work with e.g. dropout layers.\r\n      *  The embeddings are computed for all the validation data at once instead of iterating over batches.\nWhat I could also imagine to be useful is to have a kwarg called `embedding_data` instead of `validation_data_size`. This would be in line with `embedding_metadata` and allow to feed any data for embedding, be it the validation data, a subset thereof or something else. Furthermore, I currently don't see an issue with `steps`.\nThanks for the feedback @chleibig ! Additionally, is there a way to remove the argument `validation_data_size`? It seems redundant, and I don't think it is a good user experience to have to specify it.\nHi @fchollet , \r\n\r\nI agree it's redundant but we need to know the number of samples of the data to be embedded when we instantiate the `TensorBoard` callback. (Well, in `set_model` to be precise.)\r\n\r\nIf we explicitly pass the `embedding_data` to the callback as @chleibig suggested, we can get rid of the `validation_data_size`. \r\n\r\nWould that work for you?\r\n\nThanks for your comments @chleibig . I'm not sure about this statement\r\n\r\n> within `on_epoch_end` the learning phase is not set, but needed to work with e.g. dropout layers\r\n\r\nCould you please elaborate?\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's totally fine to compute the embeddings for all data at once. What's your concern with this?\r\n\nHi @dschwertfeger,\r\nsure.\r\n* Regarding the learning phase: keras uses a boolean flag (you can get the `placeholder` via `K.learning_phase()`) that indicates whether a model is used in training (e.g. dropout turned on, learning phase = 1) or testing/evaluation (e.g. dropout turned off, learning_phase = 0) phase. I don't know where this is documented, but if you go through the code base, you will find further ways how to use it, e.g. in analogy to your contribution in `on_epoch_end` within the `if self.validation_data and self.histogram_freq` clause. For your case you could as well do something like:\r\n    ```python\r\n    if self.model.uses_learning_phase:\r\n        feed_dict[K.learning_phase()] = 0\r\n   ```\r\n* Regarding the iteration over batches: Imagine the following scenario: you want to embed a few thousand data points let's say in the last hidden layer of a deep vision model. While the `embedding` of shape (n_samples, n_hidden) may still fit in memory, intermediate representations of higher dimensionality may not. Hence performing the forward passes in blocks of `self.batch_size` might be necessary. Underneath the above mentioned clause `if self.validation_data and self.histogram_freq` the data is processed as well in batches.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\nI'm trying to visualize the embedding layer output for the imdb sentiments in Keras. But I don't get the expected result. Specifically, I don't see the expected relation among words, e.g. word kingdom is not near king or queen. can this issue be related to what you have mentioned above? I get a good accuracy for the model. so I suppose the embedding should be fine too.

I'd vote for tackling this in a separate PR because it might need more discussion/clarification.\r\n\r\nThis [blog post](https://www.google.com/search?q=embeddings+tensorboard&client=firefox-b-1-ab&ei=xv93WtrzL4ud5wKA7J-QCA&start=10&sa=N&biw=1272&bih=886) seems like it might provide example code and a numpy [save_embeddings()](https://github.com/nlml/np-to-tf-embeddings-visualiser/blob/master/save_embeddings.py) which can work for multiple inputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Not quite sure what you mean by \"a detailed example would be advisable\" and your second point. Can you elaborate?\r\n\r\nSure, I meant to create a file called something like `keras/examples/cifar10_embeddings.py` which demonstrates how to use the API.\n@dschwertfeger: as the data processing in batches is still open, I have an idea that could maybe work and might even simplify the code and interface: isn't it possible to extract the embeddings (i.e. the hidden layer activations) and create an `embeddings` tensor from the hidden layer activations stored in a numpy array or alike in the very end only?\nFor clarification I had the following in mind: underneath `set_model` you currently create `embedding_vars` and `embeddings`, with the latter containing the assign statements that would have to be changed such that you only assign the batch of hidden layer activations to the respective tf.slice into `embedding_vars`. Alternatively, you could get rid of `embeddings` and use the batches (in numpy array format) returned from a `sess.run(...)` in `on_epoch_end` to build up the overall (n_samples, n_hidden) array for each embedding layer and then assign to the `embedding_vars` in one shot with e.g. `K.batch_set_value`. Either of the above two scenarios you have to decide for to get the batch issue working.\r\n\r\nThe total number of samples is however in both scenarios needed to construct the `embedding_vars`, because this in turn has to be passed to the `tf.train.Saver...` and to build up the `ProjectorConfig`. The first callback method(s) at which the `validation_data` and therewith its size is available to the `Callback` is the ones that are called at each epoch. Because it's most likely not desirable to create the `tf.train.Saver...` and the `ProjectorConfig` over and over again, I don't see a way to simplify the interface.\nI finally got around to looking into this again. I got closer to solving the issue of processing in batches. As you described in your comment from Oct 13, 2017, @chleibig, feeding the `batch_id` and assigning slices `tf.assign(embedding[batch_id:batch_id + self.batch_size], embedding_input)` works fine **if the `embedding_input` is also reshaped accordingly**. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nembedding_input = tf.reshape(embedding_input, (self.batch_size, embedding_size))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat presents another challenge because the last batch might (and very often is) smaller than the `batch_size`, in which case the reshape operation complains.\r\n\r\nAny ideas or pointers how to deal with this issue?\nIn [my comment](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/7766#discussion_r144500220), I had this scenario of course in mind, for which reason I had written it with `step` instead of `self.batch_size`. Step had actually referred to your code: `step = min(self.batch_size, n_samples - i)` I guess. Long story short, assign as many samples as you have in your current batch.\nThanks for your review, @chleibig.\r\n\r\nI'll certainly look into streamlining the use of variables and updating documentation. I feel the use-case of multi-input models deserves more discussion, though.\r\n\r\nAs [I've mentioned before](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/7766#discussion_r143716897), I'm not convinced that embedding multiple inputs in arbitrary layers yields useful results. \r\n\r\nMaybe I don't understand this well enough but my hunch is that for models with multimodal inputs, say images and their labels, you need to actually *construct* a joint embedding space rather than simply send data through the network and take the output of arbitrary layers as the \"embedding\" (see [1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.04573.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06078.pdf) for examples).\r\n\r\nWhat exactly would this embedding then represent?\r\n\r\nIs it sensible to make something work, technically, which doesn't have practical relevance (or meaning)?\r\n\r\nThis PR started as a bug fix for a broken feature. I'd really like to wrap this up and I'm wondering if we should tackle multi-input as a separate issue or feature.\r\n\r\nWhat's your view on that?\nThanks for the references @dschwertfeger and I also would like to close this issue, but in the current state, the callback may fail if used together with a model with multiple inputs. Please note that other parts of the `TensorBoard` callback do take multiple inputs into account!\r\n\r\nThinking about the practical relevance of embeddings is certainly interesting, but a bit out of scope for this PR. Anyway, I don't see any reason why \"obtaining hidden layer activations from a model and exporting them for performing low-dim embeddings in Tensorboard\" (this is what this PR introduces) would be of less practical relevance if there are multiple inputs to the model. The embeddings are determined, by the problem domain, objective, ... . Hence there are more and less meaningful scenarios;)",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR commentary highlights several key technical issues and suggestions for improvements. First, a request for before/after screenshots to clarify changes affecting TensorBoard's behavior is noted. The description of `validation_data_size` needs clearer documentation, as its ambiguity in relation to `steps` poses potential confusion. The possibility of inferring `validation_data_size` from the callback's `validation_data`, set after `set_model`, is mentioned but requires further investigation.\n\nIn the `on_epoch_end` method, the learning phase isn't properly set, which is critical for dropout layer functionality. Additionally, embeddings are computed for all validation data at once, potentially leading to memory issues when handling larger datasets; an iteration over batches is recommended. A proposal to replace `validation_data_size` with a more versatile `embedding_data` kwarg is discussed. Also, feedback involves suggestions to streamline the data processing, including creating `embeddings` only once from hidden layer activations and addressing the last batch's size when reshaping for tensor assignments."

I did update validation to work with input numpy arrays when `steps_per_epoch` is set but `validation_steps` is not set. See https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/7113#discussion_r131526240 for details.\nLarge batch sizes can run much in less wall clock time and still get better performance. For example `batch_size=600`, `steps_per_epoch=300`, `epochs=6` ran in 30% less time and predicted 0.1% more accurately. Not really relevant to this PR so I just set it to approximately match `mnist_cnn.py`.\nI think it's preferable to have them here for API consistency. Like in `fit`, it just requires your model to be compiled with a `None` loss (and a call to `add_loss` before compilation).\n@fchollet @TimZaman @Dref360 Considering the need for predict & evaluate, which then requires labels from input tensors, could we simply continue the review over at #6928, or is there a better approach?\r\n\r\nEverything from this PR #7113 is merged into #6928. \r\nWhile I know #6928 is rather large but it is the only PR that can provide a smooth transition in a single merge with decent overall API consistency. I've got everything working now in #6928 as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# API 2\r\n\r\nmodel = # on top of the tensor input\r\nmodel.add_loss()  # involving y_tensor\r\nmodel.fit(epochs=10, steps_per_epoch=1000)\r\n\r\n# API 3\r\n\r\nmodel = # on top of the tensor input\r\nmodel.compile()\r\nmodel.fit(y=y_tensor, epochs=10, steps_per_epoch=1000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are extended unit tests and support for Input Tensors with each of the following APIs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n    # train_on_batch\r\n    out = model.train_on_batch(x, y)\r\n\r\n    # test_on_batch\r\n    out = model.test_on_batch(x, y)\r\n\r\n    # predict_on_batch\r\n    out = model.predict_on_batch(x)\r\n\r\n    # fit\r\n    out = model.fit(x, y, epochs=1, batch_size=batch_size,\r\n                    steps_per_epoch=steps_per_epoch)\r\n\r\n    # evaluate\r\n    out = model.evaluate(x, y, batch_size=batch_size,\r\n                         steps=steps_per_epoch)\r\n\r\n    # predict\r\n    out = model.predict(x, batch_size=batch_size,\r\n                        steps=steps_per_epoch)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also incorporated and merged all feedback from all the split atomic PRs into #6928, so it is the canonical version with the most complete functionality for the purposes discussed here, but I'm ok with an alternative solution that works as well. :-)",
    "sumarized_length": 1034,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR addresses handling of `steps_per_epoch`, `batch_size`, and data recovery from input tensors with specific conditions for raising warnings and errors. Key suggestions include using sample counts when recoverable, and raising a warning if `steps_per_epoch` is set but ignored; a `ValueError` is raised if `batch_size` is not defined. Conversely, if sample counts cannot be recovered, a `ValueError` occurs unless `steps_per_epoch` is defined, in which case a warning is issued on `batch_size`. \n\nConcerns about mixing step-based and sample-based counting emphasize complications with the last batch and variable sizes. Notably, allowing `batch_size` is necessary for internal calculations, contradicting earlier assumptions about ignoring it. The author points out validation for input tensors isn't feasible in this PR without a complex solution but has been addressed with input numpy arrays. Finally, a more extensive review proposes ongoing improvements in PR #6928 for enhanced API consistency and performance optimizations."

I will do a detailed code review in the near future. For now, please:\n- drop the dataset and the associated example\n- scrub references to \"time\", \"rows\" and \"cols\" from the added layers (including the docstrings). \"rows\" and \"cols\" (and channels) make sense for arbitrary 4D tensors, but \"time\" does not for 5D tensors. I'd replace them with \"first_spatial_dim\", \"second_spatial_dim\", \"third_spatial_dim\", \"channels\" (if you can think of something more concise while still abstract and explicit, that's fine too).\n- Add exceptions in all added layers to output a helpful error message in case the layers are instantiated with the TensorFlow backend.\n\nThanks for the response.\nFor the references to \"time\", I have the similar concern as you, but it's not easy to find one which is abstract and explicit. \n\nIn real world, and in the context of CNN, 3D data usually means 3D volume or 2D movie. For 3D volume, it's spatial signal. And for movie, it's spatio-temporal signal. Names such as \"first_spatial_dim\", \"second_spatial_dim\" etc. would not apply in the case of a movie, because, time dimension for a movie is not the \"first spatial dim\", it's a temporal dim.\n\nMaybe other people have better ideas about how to define it, but before we find a good one, perhaps, it would still be reasonable to use \"time\":\n1. In the real world, movie-like data have a lot of applications simply because we have a lot of cameras which is capable of recording video, at least, it hard to say there is more application in 3D volume than movie, so it hard to make choice to define the first dim into time or z/depth.\n2. In 2D, most application are working on static image, and it's very natural to treat 3D as movie by default.\n3. For 1D signal, Keras say it's a temporal signal, and for 2D signal, it's spatial signal. And these assumptions are not always true, it's still useful because it matches the most common task in real-life and it's very intuitive to understand how layers work.\n4. Theano should be more general than Keras, but it still uses \"time\", \"movie\" and \"spatio-temporal\" for 3D signal. For example, in `conv3d2d.conv3d` and `nnet.conv3D`, they both used \"time\" in the docstring.\n5. When the user understand how Keras process a movie, and it would be very easy for them to extend to 3D volume data by replacing time into z dimension. Plus, we could just mention that in the docstring.\n\nSo, I would suggest we use a more specific word to make it easier to understand.\n\nIf other people have better idea on this, please discuss here.\n\nIt's precise because \"space\" does not mean physical 3D space, it means\nspace. As in, a vector space in linear algebra. In the context of\nconvolution, \"space\" means that which on which you convolve (as opposed to\n\"channels\").\n\nOn 2 February 2016 at 15:15, Will Ouyang notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Thanks for the response.\n> For the references to \"time\", I have the similar concern as you, but it's\n> not easy to find one which is abstract and explicit.\n> \n> In real world, and in the context of CNN, 3D data usually means 3D volume\n> or 2D movie.

That would be more consistent with 1D and 2D case. Examples are \"z_dim\" if we think \"rows\" and \"cols\" are from XY plane, then the extra dimension is Z.\nWhat do you think?\n\n+1 for `slices` since they could mean time-slices or 2D slices of a 3D scan\n\n@mdering I just added the support for strides by slicing the output of conv3d, it won't change the real computation, but you should get the result you want. Tell me if you have any problem, thank you.\nHere is what I did:\n`conv_out = conv_out[:, :, ::strides[0], ::strides[1], ::strides[2]]`\n\nHi, me again. These layers are not currently serializable to either json or yaml, because the relevant part of the get_config method is missing. Specifically you'll need to add \n\nbase_config = super(Convolution3D, self).get_config()\n return dict(list(base_config.items()) + list(config.items()))\n\nat the end of the method for this to work properly.\n\nEDIT: theres actually an additional error with the deserializing process, that I wasn't really able to determine the cause of. When using a deserialized model arch, i got an error: `NotImplementedError('height` and width bordermodes must match')`\nfrom https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/tensor/nnet/conv3d2d.py#L236\n\nRemoving the border_mode from the parameters passed to the Theano backend seems to have done the trick. I don't anticipate this being a problem since this parameter is always 'valid' anyway, and that is the default value. \n\nI should also add even after all this serialization and deserialization is still buggy. Maybe someone else can help more\n\n@mdering Thanks for reporting the problem, I just fixed it according to your suggestion.\n\nI think I found the problem, after deserialising, strings from the json code are becomes unicode string:\n\n``` python\njson_string = model.to_json()\nmodel2 = model_from_json(json_string)\nprint model2.layers[0].border_mode, model.layers[0].border_mode\n```\n\noutput: `(u'valid', 'valid')`\nAnd in conv3d  https://github.com/Theano/Theano/blob/master/theano/tensor/nnet/conv3d2d.py#L209 \n\n``` python\nisinstance(u'valid', str), isinstance('valid', str)\n\n```\n\noutput: `(False, True)`\n\nHowever, I didn't see any problem with model_from_yaml(), do you have any problem yaml?\n\nI have fixed the problem by passing a tuple as border_mode:\n`border_mode_3d = (border_mode, border_mode, border_mode)`\n\nMaybe we should fix model_from_json() function in Keras to prevent further problem, for now, using yaml can avoid that. In case you want to track this issue, follow #1702 .\n\nTell me if it works for you, thank you.\n",
    "sumarized_length": 1051,
    "summarized_comments": "The test results show inconsistent loss values when running the model on GPU versus CPU. This discrepancy may arise from the precision differences in the `conv3d2d.conv3d` layer. Although setting `np.random.seed(0)` was attempted, it may not function correctly due to Theano's handling. Notably, the CPU exhibits consistently higher loss values across epochs compared to the GPU.\n\nFor implementation improvements, please drop the dataset and associated example. Revise terminology by removing \"time\", \"rows\", and \"cols\" from layers and documentation, replacing them with terms like \"first_spatial_dim\" and \"channels\" for clarity in handling 5D tensors. Additionally, include error handling for unsupported TensorFlow backends in newly added layers.\n\nThe serialization process requires enhancement; ensure that the `get_config` method combines configurations properly to avoid issues like the `NotImplementedError` upon model deserialization. Also, consider addressing string encoding discrepancies when serializing to JSON, as this can introduce bugs."

Check `/.keras/models` and delete the mobillenet2 model that lives there so the new model can take its place.\r\n\r\nmy output: (I used a panda picture): https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Giant_Panda_in_Beijing_Zoo_1.JPG\r\n```\r\nUsing TensorFlow backend.\r\nPredicted: [('n02510455', 'giant_panda', 0.85812426), ('n04254680', 'soccer_ball', 0.009869265), ('n03761084', 'microwave', 0.0026237909)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also squashed the commits into a single commit.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJonathan\n@taehoonlee I will fix all the comments/naming stuff but we should probably handle the performance issue first. I re-confirmed all the weights that were extracted have been loaded. Specifically. \r\n\r\n(1) What is the preprocessing scheme being done in your test?\r\n```\r\nBatchNorm layers: 52\r\nConv2D layers: 35\r\nDepthwiseConv2D layers: 17\r\nActivations: 35 + 1 (softmax built into last Dense layer)\r\nDense: 1\r\nFlatten: 1\r\nAveragePool2D: 1\r\nInput: 1\r\nAdd: 10 (if you are using alpha = 1.0, resolution = 224. )\r\n``` \r\nFor each BatchNorm layer: there are 4 parameters. `[gamma, beta, moving_mean, moving_variance]` that are loaded in that order. When I inspect the model after:\r\n```\r\nmodel = MobileNetV2(weights='imagenet')\r\n```\r\nI notice that `gamma` and `beta` are still set to trainable. \r\n\r\nI noticed after searching around that tensorflow models come preloaded with a background class that is fine-tuned \r\n\r\nI am not sure if the tensorflow models come preloaded with a background class that has been tuned. If this is the case, their use of 1001 classes encompasses that background class. If that bg class has been fine-tuned on images that do not contain any classes, then they have an additional weight value in their FC layer that stores that information, and could be the reason why our results are not as good as theirs. \r\n\r\nIn my inference tests, which can be found [here](https://github.com/JonathanCMitchell/mobilenet_v2_keras/blob/master/test_mobilenet.py#L100), I simply popped out the first layer and then re-normalized the logit values, removing that background class.\r\n\r\nTensorflow data for last layer:\r\n```\r\n {'block_id': 19,\r\n  'key': 'MobilenetV2/Logits/Conv2d_1c_1x1/weights',\r\n  'layer': 'Logits',\r\n  'meta': 'weights',\r\n  'mod': '',\r\n  'shape': (1, 1, 1280, 1001)},\r\n {'block_id': 19,\r\n  'key': 'MobilenetV2/Logits/Conv2d_1c_1x1/biases',\r\n  'layer': 'Logits',\r\n  'meta': 'biases',\r\n  'mod': '',\r\n  'shape': (1001,)}]\r\n```\r\nSo when I loaded the weights I used `weights[:, 1:]` and `biases[1:]`. This can be seen [here](https://github.com/JonathanCMitchell/mobilenet_v2_keras/blob/3c8ce250baff6b07879c68b4e3e02ab08e82a5e1/load_weights_multiple.py#L194)\r\n\r\n(2) Do you happen to know what class fails the test? I do not have the imagenet dataset saved locally and I currently don't have the resources to run the evaluation.\r\n\r\nI thought it could also be the fact that I am using AveragePooling2D followed by a Flatten layer, but in my implementation, I am doing the same thing as GlobalAveragePooling2D because I calculate the pool size from the previous layers spatial resolution. \r\n`pool_size = tuple(x.get_shape().as_list()[1:3])`\r\n\r\nI do not calculate the pool size for models built with CNTK or Theano, so I don't want to add that feature until I know that this model's performance is acceptable.\r\n\r\nCould it be the way we perform `softmax` vs the way tensorflow performs `softmax`?\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to investigate. I re-converted all the weights and tested them locally and checked the number of loaded weights and they matched the model exactly. \nI loaded up the Tensorflow model and grabbed the first feature map after the first Conv2D + BatchNorm + Relu and checked the feature map against the MobileNetV2 keras model's, and we have different values.\r\n\r\nI checked the weights in the `Conv2D` and `BatchNorm` layers and we have the exact same weight values and shape. Therefore, it could be the following:\r\nThe way their convolutional kernels operate is different from ours. \r\nThe way their BatchNorm procedure operates is different.\r\nThey are using a different form of image padding.\r\n\r\nIt might have something to do with [_fixed_padding](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet/conv_blocks.py#L24), but I have yet to figure out how to make ours match.\r\n\r\nI tried grabbing the output after the first convolutional operation, but I could not find a pointer to it from the checkpoint file alone. \nFor the additional class, simply splicing out the first index of the final weight and bias should be sufficient. \r\n\r\nFor the weights that you ported, you can check against the port in my repo (https://github.com/titu1994/MobileNetworks).\r\n\r\nThe model for V1 and V2 are separated inside the singular mobilenet.py. Inferece on random cheetah and elephant images seems to give correct class values. \r\n\r\nFor the weight transfer, mine is a bit more hands-on, and can be seen in _weight_transfer_v2 folder. For the background check removal, it's the last few lines inside the weight transfer scripts there. \r\n\r\nEdit : Forgot to mention, it doesn't use the 1.01e-5 trick for Theano, so it would be better to test on Tensorflow for now \n@titu1994 I mean the imagenet prediction score or the feature map outputs. I am in the process of running your model to extract the first feature map and compare it against the tensorflow one for the same input. \r\n\r\nWhen I ran your model and compared the feature maps, they are different from the tensorflow model (just like mine is). Moreover, when I ran the image presented in [mobilenet_example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet/mobilenet_example.ipynb) I did not get the same output logic score, even though I got the same label value as the argmax. \r\n\r\nWhy did you do `_make_divisible_` for the number of channels in the depthwise layers? This will likely break the model when alpha = 0.5 at resolution 160.\r\n\r\nI took the panda.jpg image from this url:         \r\nurl = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Giant_Panda_in_Beijing_Zoo_1.JPG'\r\n\r\nThen I preprocessed it the same way they did in the notebook, and then ran it through my MobileNetV2, your MobileNetV2, and the Tensorflow model, and here are the results:\r\n\r\nHere are the max output_logit scores:\r\n```\r\nYours: 0.84206843\r\nMine:  0.85812426\r\nTensorflows:  0.8662165\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, they are all different. :X\r\n\r\nAlso, the total # of parameters for both our models match:\r\nYour # params: \r\n```\r\nTotal params: 3,538,984\r\nTrainable params: 3,504,872\r\nNon-trainable params: 34,112\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy # params:\r\n```\r\nTotal params: 3,538,984\r\nTrainable params: 3,504,872\r\nNon-trainable params: 34,112\r\n```\r\nHere you can see a [gist](https://gist.github.com/JonathanCMitchell/9e4ad8254caa74f7d265e19fe55c45f1) describing the difference in our model summaries: \nGotcha! so I loaded the checkpoint with `tf.train.NewCheckpointReader` and then read all the stuff in the checkpoint file, and used `get_tensor(<tensorname>)` to receive them. I am probably not using the EWA weights. see [here](https://github.com/JonathanCMitchell/mobilenet_v2_keras/blob/master/extract_weights.py#L26)\n@titu1994 I'm not on my linux machine so I can't test atm, but how did you extract the EWA weights? Did you use tf.train.NewCheckpointReader? If I can do it for one of them, I will do it for all the weight files\r\n\r\nedit: I think I see how you did it [here](https://github.com/titu1994/MobileNetworks/blob/master/_weight_extraction_v2/extract_weights.py#L73). \r\n\r\nI will hop on this tomorrow in the AM, and try to re-convert all the models using the EMA weights to see if I can match the same precision as the TF model. @titu1994 Do you know if the frozen model is using EMA weights? Also, in the repo it says that restoring using EMA weights only produces 1-2% higher accuracy, but the imagenet results that @taehoonlee claimed were ~10% lower.\n@JonathanCMitchell My procedure is different from yours by a lot. I am extracting the weights at the numpy level into separate files and then loading them up layer by layer. [See this directory for weight extraction and loading](https://github.com/titu1994/MobileNetworks/tree/master/_weight_extraction_v2).\r\n\r\nI would think that NewCheckpointReader does get the EMA weights, however, it does not have a reference to the `tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverages(0.999)` part, so it is unable to restore it ? I don't use EMA much so I don't know the exact procedure.\r\n\r\nBlindly following the evaluation script, the steps would be something akin to : \r\n\r\n1) Build MobileNet graph\r\n2) Create the EMA object and get its variables\r\n3) Tell Saver to restore only those variables and then use a Session to restore the graph with its original weights + EMA weights. \r\n\r\nHowever, at this step, how one would go about extracting just the EMA weights, I am unable to answer. \r\n\r\nAs much as I can tell, my scripts to extract numpy weights and then load them up by hand seem to work correctly. Since our models match in parameter size, you should be able to drop-in replace my model with yours and use my weight extraction + loading script without any change.\r\n\r\nEdit : \r\n\r\nThe actual procedure is quite automated with only a few steps which have to be done manually.\r\n\r\n1) Placing the checkpoint in the checkpoint dir\r\n2) Editing `extract_weights.py` at line 10 `checkpoint_file = 'checkpoint/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224.ckpt'` to change the file name to point to the new checkpoint and then running it\r\n3) Editing `weight_load.py` at lines 7-8 to configure the model, then simply run. It handles everything and dumps a new weight file inside the `root-of-the-directory/weights` folder\n@titu1994 Yeah I do pretty much the same thing as you, I actually realized that I was just ignoring the EMA weights entirely and using the normal weights instead. In my approach I save the numpy files, but I also generate a guide that records the shape, metadata, and other information about the layers so I can be certain that they fill the right slot. Did you update the model file in your git release so I can try to plug N play with it tomorrow? ",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR discussion addresses multiple technical aspects of improving the Keras implementation of MobileNetV2. Key concerns include fixing PEP8 errors and ensuring effective unit testing, with the reviewer requesting specific guidance on test implementation and execution, which was initially unclear to the contributor. The contributor resolved the PEP8 issues and corrected the model’s class count from 1001 to 1000, aligning with the omission of the background class.\n\nAdditionally, the contributor implemented error handling for input tensor shape discrepancies. There were minor issues with test failures related to unrelated files, but the reviewer confirmed these errors were not attributable to the contributor’s changes. The discussion also highlights security considerations regarding weight handling and the necessity of using dependencies like NumPy for preprocessing. Lastly, performance optimization concerns were raised about BatchNorm layers and the potential impact of different implementation practices (e.g., softmax operations) between the Keras and TensorFlow models."

That is a very different type of API, but it would look like this:\n\n```\nbranch1 = Sequential()\nbranch1.add(Dense(10,10))\nbranch1.add(LSTM(10))\nbranch1.add(Dense(10))\nbranch1.add(Dense(1))\n\nbranch2 = Sequential()\nbranch1.add(Dense(10,10))\nbranch1.add(Dense(10))\nbranch1.add(Dense(10))\nbranch1.add(Dense(1))\n\nmodel = Sequential(inputs=[branch1,branch2],merge_mode='sum',shared_tuples=[(branch1.layers[0],branch2.layers[0]),(branch1.layers[2],branch2.layers[2]))\n```\n\nOr simply by index:\n`model = Sequential(inputs=[branch1,branch2],merge_mode='sum',shared_indices=[0,2])`\nWhich tells Sequential that the 1st and 3rd layer in each branch should be tied. Of course if they are different sizes, then it would throw an error, etc. But this would even let the branches be different lengths as long as the linked-up layers are actually identical.\n\nHmm. The simply by index API sounds good.. But again, under the hood, I am not explicitly tying up/sharing anything.. Because it is almost impossible due to theano issues, learning issues and performance issues.

I am trying to do a generalized solution, where any layer could be added as a shared layer, without disturbing the way we train  the model..\n\n> @mikekestemont Isnt that too specific to a particular problem? I am trying to do a generalized solution, where any layer could be added as a shared layer, without disturbing the way we train the model..\n\nYes, this is indeed specific but I was thinking that one could build a more generic implementation based on that idea. A `merge` could simply be implemented in a specific layer that reduces the batch size by a factor 2.\n\n>  Can i see some pseudo code demonstrating how the API would look like? For e.g, the 2nd model in my first comment.. what would it look like ?\n\nIt could be something like:\n\n``` python\ng = Graph()\ng.add_input(name='input_pairs', input_shape=input_shape)\ng.add_node(name='shared_dense_1', input='input_pair', Dense())\ng.add_node(name='left_dense_1', input='shared_dense_1', Dense(), filter='even')\ng.add_node(name='right_lstm_1', input='shared_dense_1', LSTM(), filter='odd')\ng.add_node(name='shared_dense_2', inputs=['left_dense_1', 'right_lstm_1'], Dense(), merge_mode='batch_merge')\ng.add_node(name='left_dense_2', input='shared_dense_2', Dense(), filter='even')\ng.add_node(name='right_dense', input='shared_dense_2', Dense(), filter='odd')\ng.add_node(name='merge', inputs=['left_dense_2', 'right_dense'], Merge(), merge_mode='batch_merge')\n```\n\nA `filter` mode would select the correct elements in the batch and the `batch_merge` merge mode would pick the correct elements from its two inputs (even elements from first input and odd from second).\n\n@benjaminklein  Consider the case where you are asked to make a model, which when given 2 sentences, gives a number representing how similar they are. You would:\n\n``` python\n\ns1 = Sequential()\ns1.add(Embedding(...))\ns1.add(LSTM(...))\ns1.add(Dense(...))\n\ns2 = Sequential()\ns2.add(Embedding(...))\ns2.add(LSTM(...))\ns2.add(Dense(...))\n\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Merge([s1,s2], 'dot'))\nmodel.add(Dense(1))\nmodel.add(Activation('sigmoid'))\n```\n\nThe above model has the following problems:\n- **Order sensitive**: `similarity('hai', 'hello')` will be different from `similarity('hello','hai')`. Forcing you to iterate over your training set multiple times, each time shuffling your inputs..i.e, you would have to train ['hai', 'hello', 0.9] as well as ['hello', 'hai', 0.9]. Which means 2x training time. Now if your model have n inputs, you would have to iterate over your training set factorial(n) times to make your model order insensitive.\n- **Model is heavy**: You have multiple layers for doing the same thing, that is learn phrase representation. This leads to redundancy, which means your model will have higher memory requirements and heavier file size(when you serialize/save weights).\n\n**Solution**\n\n``` python\ns1 = Sequential()\ns2 = Sequential()\n\n#add shared layers\nadd_shared_layer(Embedding(...), [s1, s2])\nadd_shared_layer(LSTM(...), [s1, s2])\nadd_shared_layer(Dense(...), [s1, s2])\n\n#everything else as usual\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Merge([s1,s2], 'dot'))\nmodel.add(Dense(1))\nmodel.add(Activation('sigmoid'))\n```\n\nHope this helps!\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment discusses a proposed architectural change to improve the API for sharing layers in neural network models. It suggests an alternative design using a `Sequential` model with explicit branch construction and layer sharing through `shared_tuples` or `shared_indices`. The proposed `shared_indices` approach allows for tying layers by their indices, but raises concerns about not explicitly managing sharing, which can lead to issues in optimization and learning due to Theano limitations.\n\nThere is acknowledgment that this implementation could result in different branch lengths but should accommodate shared layers effectively. The discussion also highlights the complexities of merging outputs and addresses the need to remove the separate `input` argument for improved modeling flexibility. A generalized solution is favored, allowing various layers to be added as shared without disrupting training. Additionally, concerns about redundancy and model weight management in similarity estimation tasks are raised, leading to suggestions for creating a more efficient shared layer implementation."

I didn't pull your branch though, so no guarantees.\nThanks @gabrieldemarmiesse . You were right, the problem was there. Furthermore, the patch had a conceptual error, because the element-wise weights should have the size of `score_array`, not the output. Both have been fixed with commit d5701ea76eb6a4df21a5a7dc61a9b6734c3b2d85. \r\n\r\nI still need to do some tests and write the test units.\nMy last commits broke the [10782.8 test, Python: 2.7, KERAS_BACKEND=cntk](https://travis-ci.org/keras-team/keras/jobs/430339525) in the Travis CI build, in particular `tests/test_multiprocessing.py::test_multiprocessing_predict_error`.\r\n\r\nCan't debug for the moment, because keras docker requires [`nvidia-docker`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker), which doesn't accept Ubuntu 17.10 (my current distribution).\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I had to:\r\n * Edit `keras/docker/Makefile`, adding `--network host` to the build, because otherwise my computer cannot reach ubuntu servers\r\n```Makefile\r\ndocker build -t keras --build-arg python_version=$(PYTHON_VERSION) ...\r\n```\r\n * Edit `keras/docker/Dockerfile`, replacing \r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\ngit clone http://github.com/\r\n```\r\nand replacing \r\n```\r\npip install git+git://github.com/keras-team/keras.git\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\npip install git+http://github.com/keras-team/keras.git\r\n```\r\nbecause otherwise the `git` and `pip` commands time out without completing.\nThe error is not due to your commit. It is a flaky test. I'll restart the build for you. You can also install keras cpu by folowing the instructions in `.travis.yml` to debug stuff locally.\nYou should add unit tests. It would allow us to know the \"health\" of the PR and to help you better. Can you add this at the end of `test_training.py`? I encourage you to run this test locally on cpu in case you'll need to debug it. Please push it and we'll be able to see better if your PR runs well :)\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_elementwize_weights():\r\n\r\n    im = np.zeros((10, 5, 5, 3))\r\n    out1 = np.ones((10, 5, 5, 1))\r\n    out2 = np.ones((10, 5, 5, 2))\r\n\r\n    input_tensor = Input(shape=im.shape[1:])\r\n    main_output = Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(1, 1), strides=1, padding='same',\r\n                         name='main_output')(input_tensor)\r\n    aux_output = Conv2D(filters=2, kernel_size=(1, 1), strides=3, padding='same',\r\n                        name='aux_output')(input_tensor)\r\n    model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[main_output, aux_output])\r\n\r\n    model.compile(loss='mae', optimizer='sgd',\r\n                  sample_weight_mode=['element', 'element'])\r\n\r\n    model.fit(im, [out1, out2],\r\n              sample_weight=[out1, out2],\r\n              batch_size=3, epochs=3)\r\n```\r\nI don't guarantee that this small test will run. You may need to adapt it if it throws an error.\nI've dug a bit into this PR and I thing quite a lot of code needs to be changed to be able to support elementwise weighting. Here is the example to illustrate the problem (it's also a nice unit test for people who want to try to make this PR work):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_elementwise_weights():\r\n    im = np.zeros((10, 5, 5, 3))\r\n    out1 = np.ones((10, 5, 5, 1))\r\n    out2 = np.ones((10, 2, 2, 2))\r\n\r\n    input_tensor = Input(shape=im.shape[1:])\r\n    main_output = Conv2D(filters=1, kernel_size=(1, 1), strides=1, padding='same',\r\n                         name='main_output')(input_tensor)\r\n    aux_output = Conv2D(filters=2, kernel_size=(1, 1), strides=3, padding='same',\r\n                        name='aux_output')(input_tensor)\r\n    model = Model(inputs=input_tensor, outputs=[main_output, aux_output])\r\n\r\n    model.compile(loss='mae', optimizer='sgd',\r\n                  sample_weight_mode=['element', 'element'])\r\n\r\n    model.fit(im, [out1, out2],\r\n              sample_weight=[out1[..., 0], out2[..., 0]],\r\n              batch_size=3, epochs=2) # works\r\n\r\n    def dummy_loss(y_true, y_pred):\r\n        return K.mean(mae(y_true, y_pred), axis=-1)\r\n\r\n    model.compile(loss=dummy_loss, optimizer='sgd',\r\n                  sample_weight_mode=['element', 'element']) \r\n\r\n    model.fit(im, [out1, out2],\r\n              sample_weight=[out1[..., 0, 0], out2[..., 0, 0]],\r\n              batch_size=3, epochs=2) # fails here\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that **we cannot know the shape of the placeholders for the weights before computing the loss**. That means that we need to create the placeholders in the function `weighted_loss`.  In other words, we need to delay the creation of the placeholders.\n@gabrieldemarmiesse Yes, but working on something for ISBI, deadline in a few days, so I had to put it to the side sorry :(. I tried setting up a testing environment from the code in `.travis.yml`, but the keras tests didn't work straight away with it, so I must have missed something, and I'm going to have to deal with my deadline, and then revisit. \r\n\r\nThe weights need to be the same size as the `score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)` in [`training_utils.py#L403`](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/6f9e709278e1643a6c52c052de0a0d8384849c64/keras/engine/training_utils.py#L403) so that then they can be weighted in ([L413](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/6f9e709278e1643a6c52c052de0a0d8384849c64/keras/engine/training_utils.py#L413))\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        # apply sample weighting\r\n        if weights is not None:\r\n            # reduce score_array to same ndim as weight array, for the cases of\r\n            # one weight per sample and 2D weights for temporal data\r\n            ndim = K.ndim(score_array)\r\n            weight_ndim = K.ndim(weights)\r\n            score_array = K.mean(score_array,\r\n                                 axis=list(range(weight_ndim, ndim)))\r\n            score_array *= weights\r\n            score_array /= K.mean(K.cast(K.not_equal(weights, 0), K.floatx()))\r\n```\r\n\n> The weights need to be the same size as the `score_array = fn(y_true, y_pred)`\r\nIndeed, this is the issue. In the code that you modified, there is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif isinstance(self.output_shape, list):\r\n    ndim = len(self.output_shape[i]) - 1\r\nelse:\r\n    ndim = len(self.output_shape) - 1\r\nweight = K.placeholder(ndim=ndim,\r\n                                      name=name + '_sample_weights')\r\n```\r\nAnd here is it assumed that the number of dimentions of the loss (and weights) is the number of dimensions of the network output minus one. Which may not be the case, for example with a loss like this, it needs to be minus two:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef dummy_loss(y_true, y_pred):\r\n        return K.mean(mae(y_true, y_pred), axis=-1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@fchollet, this is not trivial at all. How do you think we should proceed? \n@gabrieldemarmiesse @fchollet Would it be possible to extend the loss function interface, to take an optional `weights` parameter?\r\n\r\nSetting `sample_weight_mode='element'` would return an error if the loss function hasn't been extended with the `weights` parameter for `element` (we can check with e.g. `loss.__code__.co_varnames` in python 3).\r\n\r\nIf the function has not been extended, but no weights are provided, it works in the same way as it currently does.\r\n\r\nBut if has been extended, weights then can be passed. \r\n\r\nThis approach would also also allow more flexibility: weights per output element, weights per output score... depending on how the user wants to implement the loss function.\r\n\r\nAnd because the element-wise weighting would be dealt with internally in the loss function, and the `score_array` would have the same size it already has, I think no further changes would be necessary in keras.\r\n\r\nExisting code would also keep working. And people who don't need weights could implement their loss functions without that argument.\n@gabrieldemarmiesse Sorry, can't make the test environment work. I have followed the steps in `.travis.yml` to create a local environment, and documented it here in [Create local testing environment for keras](https://github.com/rcasero/doc/wiki/Create-local-testing-environment-for-keras).

Specifically, corrections to element-wise weighting were made in commit `d5701ea`, addressing placeholder dimensionality in `training.py`, which you plan to revise by checking the weights' dimensions in `fit()`. \n\nAdding unit tests was emphasized to assess the PR's integrity, and a prototype test function was suggested.

Similar to `control_dependencies` in TF. If yes, we can do it. If not, never mind. Theano is EOL anyway.\nA complication is that current callbacks expect to be passed batch-wise metrics in `on_batch_end`, rather than current averages. In that regard, the plan above would be a breaking behavior change.\nAdded clean support for logging stateful metrics. Now properly handled by the progbar. Also did some refactoring while I was at it. PTAL.\nCan stateful metrics define different expected y_true, y_pred dimensions?\r\n\r\nThe typical case where label dimension != output dimensions are varying forms of multiple hypothesis networks.

For such a head, we do no checks on output/target shape match. You could apply a custom stateful metric to such a head and things would work, I suppose\n> This discussion more or less took place in: #9200 #8657\r\n\r\n@brge17 Thanks for the issue links, I hadn't seen them!\r\n\r\n@fchollet two stateful metrics API UX questions:\r\n\r\n1. Can [tf.metrics](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/metrics) and [tf.contrib.metrics](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/metrics) mentioned in the linked discussion easily be adapted to the proposed API, particularly the `streaming_` versions?\r\n2. Can we design the stateful metrics API UX to look like a streaming statistical API such as [boltons.statsutils](http://boltons.readthedocs.io/en/latest/statsutils.html)?\r\n\r\nItem 2 is what I was really thinking of and it is a much clearer example than when [I posted linking tqdm](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/pull/9253#discussion_r165804386). \n1. That's the whole point of this PR is so you can support an arbitrary metric.\r\n\r\nWith stateful metrics, you can compute any function of y_pred, y_true.\r\n\r\nThat's why I'm so desperatly trying to get it through. (@brge17 is my work github).\r\n\r\n2. We can't discuss specific stateful metrics, until we have support for the general case. (Can't run before we can walk).\r\n\r\nStep 1 is support stateful metrics (this PR), step 2 is write stateful metrics for tf.metrics/common users wants. (follow on PRs). At the very least users can write their own in the mean time.\r\n\r\nThis API is functionally identical to how TensorFlow metrics work under the hood. We are replicating that functionality.\nHere's an example to stress point 1.\r\n\r\nSay you want to have a metric like True Positive Rate:\r\n\r\nOption 1: (Use states wisely) Save the number of True Positives and the number of Positives in the states. Each batch return True Positives/Positives.\r\n\r\nOption 2: (Naive brute force) cache all predictions and recompute the metric every batch.\r\n\r\nThe tf.metrics you referenced always do 1 (or option 3 an approximate metric that is more compute/memory efficient see the tf AUC implementation). Which is how we will implement AUC/Precision/Recall/Confusion Matrix, etc... The user always has the option to do 2 (although super inefficient an a huge waste of memory).\r\n\r\nAs it sits without this PR, you have no options to use metrics as is because they only batchwise averages. The solution to get around it is inefficient/hacky code in a custom callback.\r\n\r\nAs the PR currently sits, no changes if you are using non-stateful metrics. It just enables the future development of stateful metrics.\n> Here's an example to stress point 1.\r\n> Say you want to a metric like True Positive Rate:\r\n> Option 1: (Use states wisely) Save the number of True Positives and the number of Positives in the states.

    "sumarized_length": 1083,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR proposes a significant shift towards stateful metrics. The suggested architecture includes a `Metric` class to encapsulate statefulness and a `SamplewiseMetric` subclass for handling metric averaging. This design allows the callbacks and progress bars to remain agnostic to how metrics are implemented. However, this change could introduce breaking changes since current callbacks expect batch-wise metrics in `on_batch_end`.\n\nThere's also an inquiry about Theano's API capabilities for specifying execution order, but it may be irrelevant due to its end-of-life status. The new implementation allows for proper logging of stateful metrics with the progbar, addressing clean support for metrics requiring varied dimensions between `y_true` and `y_pred`.\n\nKey UX questions suggest adapting TensorFlow's existing metrics APIs to this new model, with a focus on user-defined stateful metrics as a follow-up. The underlying intent is to align functionality with TensorFlow's metrics without requiring users to compromise efficiency in implementing metrics like True Positive Rate."

Relevant issue https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/883. Could you add some tests to a basic operation and serialization? Also, I suggest you to call this layer `MaskedLambda` and we may need `Lambda` to inherit from `Layer` instead. If you try `MaskedLambda` after, say `Dense`, Keras may complain about it.\n\nAdded Serialization test. Works like a charm on python 2.7. Python 3 upset again.\n\n> @fchollet What do you think?\n\nI think marshaling is a good solution to the serialization issue. This is looking good.\n\nI haven't checked out the tests yet. As for the layer itself, what it needs would be:\n- a docstring specifying the meaning and format of the arguments. Much like [this](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/convolutional.py#L409). It is not necessary for most layers, but in this case it is not immediately obvious what the purpose of the Lambda layer is, and because of polymorphism it is not obvious either how to use it. So that should be made clear.\n- enforcement of argument expectations via type checks and exception raising. Again, necessary in this case because of the polymorphism. \n\n@fchollet Please help me out. Why is `join` `Merge` returning an `OrderedDic` rather than the more intuitive `list` of `tensor`? What are we accomplishing by making sure that the layer outputs are named (explicitly) ? \n\n> What are we accomplishing by making sure that the layer outputs are named (explicitly) ?\n\nTwo things:\n- more flexible layer connectivity. Let's say a layer returns a list of tensors [A, B, C] and you want to connect to a layer that takes 3 inputs, but will expect the order [C, A, B]. It's easy and explicit to achieve if you are returning dictionaries rather than lists, and if you can pass a connectivity map that says \"connect A to input 1, C to input 0 and B to input 2\". \n- API consistency. To achieve recursive compositionality, which is a big strength of Keras, you need layers to behave like containers (Graph / Sequential). The Graph layer takes as inputs dictionaries of tensors and returns the same. So we need multi-io layers to follow the same API and to return dictionaries of tensors.\n\nAs for implicit naming -- in general we should not act in \"creative\" ways that aren't explicitly controlled by the user. Picking names for layers (that won't be displayed anywhere) is too much interference on our part, at least with the current API. We can consider it when we set up a global layer naming scheme, where every layer will take a `name` argument that will be filled intelligently by default. Such a scheme might come roughly at the same time as the future abstract backend.\n\n@fchollet  Agreed. Also, implicit naming of layers using a global nomenclature seems to be a great idea. A layer name could be Layer type + index. Like`fc1`, `fc2`, `relu1`, `conv1` etc. \n\nYou do that with a graph\n\n``` python\nmodel.add(layer, inputs=['prev_1', 'prev_2'], merge_mode='join')\n```\n\nKeras sets the names of the outputs `prev_1`and `prev_2`. What exactly is your problem? You can always transform an OrderedDict to a list as `list(dict.items())` to be python2/3 friendly.\n\n@EderSantana  My exact problem is that I want to make the 'Sum merge using Lambda layer' example given in the first comment work, without making any changes to the `Merge` class.\n\nI understand now, just make sure the `Tensors` you are summing up have the `name` property. For example\n\n``` python\nX = T.matrix('any_name_works')  # or\nX = T.matrix()\nX.name = 'any_name_at_all\n```\n\nyou can always put the `Lambda` layer inside a `Graph` so Keras you name everything for you.\n\n@EderSantana  Then we would have to use `Graph` for a purely Sequential problem. Let me try if I can do something with least changes to the working of `Merge` layer.\n\nhere is how `container.Graph` does it https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/containers.py#L236\n\n> IMHO the real problem is the fact that Sequential does not implement \"naming\" yet.\n\nYes, this is the real issue here. As mentioned previously, I hope we will soon have a framework-wide naming system, where every layer / container will accept a `name` argument and will have a `set_name` method, and where names not provided will be automatically generated using a scheme that will be both intuitive and explicitly documented.\n\nWe had a PR for a pretty good naming system some time ago, but it made use of initialization functions as name-injection mechanism, which we decided against. As we introduce an abstract backend, we will have access to a variable instantiation system that will replace `sharedX` and the like, and that will be used as the go-to name-injection mechanism.\n\n> If there is no LambdaMerge we will fill up the Merge class with too many modes, and each of these modes will be used even rarely.\n\nI would agree with this point. I see the use case, and I think it's a good solution. It does contribute to make Keras more flexible.\n\nThen again of course, it does makes for a much simpler UX to have the most common merge modes covered in the base `Merge` layers.\n\nBy the way, this solution works great in terms of compatibility with single-output / single-input layers (unnamed), but as far as I can tell it isn't compatible with multi-io layers (i.e. `Graph`, with named inputs / ouputs). \n",

The `Lambda` layer should be renamed to `MaskedLambda` for clarity, and it’s recommended that `Lambda` inherit from `Layer` to enhance functionality. Serialization issues appear to be resolved with marshaling, but tests for basic operations and serialization need to be added, particularly addressing compatibility across Python 2.7 and 3. \n\nDocumentation is lacking; a comprehensive docstring specifying argument formats is crucial due to polymorphism. Type checks for arguments should be enforced to raise exceptions when expectations aren't met. \n\nConcerns were expressed regarding the `Merge` class returning an `OrderedDict` rather than a list, emphasizing that explicit output naming enhances flexibility in layer connectivity. A global naming system for layers is also proposed, to automate name generation based on type and index for better consistency across the API. Overall, the implementation requires improvements in documentation, testing, and adherence to a structured naming convention."

    "unsumarized_comments": "The key here is that the constants (the “attended” when used for attention) _really are inputs_ to the the recurrent layer (I refer to them as “external” constants in docs but maybe we need a better name). I think it would be bad and confusing to break the principle that _all inputs to a layer should be passed to that layer_ in `__call__`, i.e. when it is _applied_ to its inputs in the functional API.\r\n\r\nThe constant(s) needed for attention is fundamentally different from dropout, as the later is only a regularisation method and we _don’t pass the dropout values in inference mode_ (they are only generated in in training) but the attended, of course, have to passed as input.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to implementation/API, it is certainly possible to implement attention in keras only using custom wrapper - I’ve done it several times and that was the solution in my original API suggestion, which I think is worse  ;).\r\n\r\nBut let’s looks at some options...\r\n\r\nThis is the “look and feel” to the user of my current suggestion:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput_sequence = Input((timesteps, features))\r\nattended_sequence = Input((attended_timesteps, attended_features))\r\n\r\nattention_lstm = RNN(\r\n    cell=SequenceAttention(LSTMCell(32)),\r\n    return_sequences=True  # could of course be False in another use-case\r\n)\r\nlstm_output_sequence = attention_lstm(\r\n    input_sequence,\r\n    constants=attended_sequence\r\n)\r\n\r\noutput_layer = TimeDistributed(Dense(n_labels, activation='softmax'))\r\noutput = output_layer(lstm_output_sequence)\r\n\r\nmodel = Model(inputs=[input_sequence, attended_sequence], outputs=output)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess what your suggestion means is that you would only let the cell know about the attended, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncell = SequenceAttention(LSTMCell(32), attended=attended_sequence)\r\nattention_lstm = RNN(cell=cell, return_sequences=True)\r\nlstm_output_sequence = attention_lstm(input_sequence)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr maybe:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncell = SequenceAttention(LSTMCell(32))\r\ncell.attended = attended_sequence\r\nattention_lstm = RNN(cell=cell, return_sequences=True)\r\nlstm_output_sequence = attention_lstm(input_sequence)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can probably make this work but I'd like to avoid it for a number of reasons: \r\n\r\n1. I don’t think there is any other situation in keras where one would _inject an input tensor in the init of a layer_ - it feels intuitively wrong to have these implicit inputs (for which we, again, have to pass data for both in training an inference). \r\n\r\n2. If not all inputs are passed in call, it breaks the possibility to easily reuse the layer in several places of the computational graph.\r\n\r\n3. Typically you need to _build_ the attention mechanism (initialise weights etc.) and I see no reason why this shouldn’t be done in the `build` method (triggered by `__call__`) where you get the input shapes of all inputs.\r\n\r\nI think a good comparison is why we can (optionally) pass `initial_state` to the RNN. If we do, it should really be considered an input (it needs to be passed in inference) - otherwise it's an \"internal thing\" like dropout. Just like the initial state, the attended can (or _will_ in most cases) be the output of a previous layer.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to treat the attended as part of the `initial_state` but that's a hack I think and leads to several challenges.\r\n\r\nYet another (better) option is to add a new class `AttentionRNN(RNN)` which adds the functionality suggested in this PR without touching the existing RNN - but then you need to both wrap the cell with an attention mechanism and use another Parent RNN layer for using it. This would be fine I think but since the addition in `RNN` just adds an additional optional argument and is backward compatible I thought it would be better this way.\r\n\r\nIt is also, of course, possible that I'm missing some other option. Please question the above!\nThe fact that we in the current RNN implementation \"temporarily\" modify the `input_spec` when `initial_state` is passed (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L453) is very related to this discussion. I've just extended the same behaviour for constants but I don't really like it. Just like  @farizrahman4u points out in a comment on the second PR: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/7981 it would be better to be explicit about all tensors that really are inputs in the `input_spec`\n> Could we move attention support to the base class RNN altogether?\r\n\r\nThis is _exactly_ what I implemented in a backward compatible way (and tested) in the original version of this PR (I then used the keyword argument `constants`): https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/7980/commits/28795f14ba734d0d97cf292e601d7ab00039f401\r\n\r\n> Also: what would be some alternative names for `attended`? `attended_sequence`?\r\n\r\nAs discussed above, \"sequence\" should not be in the name. Again, the attended can be anything (including multiple) tensors. A standard application is image captioning where the attended is an image (or typically CNN feature maps of an image).\r\n\r\nI do still think it would be better to support passing, what I originally referred to i docs as, _external constants_ in the base `RNN`, which forwards them to `cell.call`, as well as their shapes to `cell.build` if the cell is a keras layer. And yes, if such constants are passed in `RNN.__call__` it is required that  `cell.call` accepts them.\r\n\r\nAs per the current state of this PR, `RNN` is purely a special case of `AttentionRNN` (with `attended=None`) which is a bit strange. I agreed to your suggestion to put this logic in a new separate class with (as I wrote) the main motivation being \"avoiding adding any additional complexity to the `RNN`\" and perhaps to move forward a bit faster ;). There is value in minimising complexity of the base `RNN`class, but the question is if this motivates a whole new class which is just a _generalisation_ of the first.\r\n\r\nRegarding naming: If we were to stick to an additional separate `AttentionRNN`, I think `attended` is the best name. As suggested previously, `attended_inputs` is also an alternative. However, if we move back support of \"external constants\" to `RNN` I think `attended` is a confusing and unnecessary _limiting_ name. I can't come up with a better name than `constants` for this case, and make clear in documentation that \"these are tensors that will be passed _in whole_ to `cell.call` for each time step\" as was done in original PR, see: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/7980/commits/28795f14ba734d0d97cf292e601d7ab00039f401#diff-3118e4e28157032506f771f279a551c3R281\r\n\r\nGenerally, I prefer to consider `RNN` the component in the _Keras `Layer`-abstraction level_ that corresponds to the Keras backend's `K.rnn` or e.g. `theano.scan`. There is a reason why both of these takes an argument for \"external constants\". In `K.rnn` the keyword `constants` is used and `theano.scan` uses `non_sequences`. In theano there are optimisation reasons for passing these (not utilised in keras backend!?) and it is not required to pass such constants to a \"control flow op\" if it suports \"partialising\" of the step function with preset tensors. We discussed this \"partialisation\" in our initial discussion and it is not an option on the Keras `Layer`-abstraction level as we need (want!) to be explicit about all inputs and outputs of layers.\r\n\r\nThe theano \"non_sequences\" is not a very user-friendly name as these \"external constants\" could be sequences _but not iterated over by the RNN cell_. The reason I don't want to go for `attended` as keyword in `RNN` is that they could be used for other things (you could e.g. write cell wrappers that implements recurrent dropout for any cell based on these constants...)\r\n\r\n...I apologise for these \"essay\" comments. This is an intricate matter. I've really tried to do a thorough requirements analysis with respect to both how Attention is used in research and the current state of Keras (which e.g. lead to my conclusion that the RNNCell should really be broken out before this addition). Perhaps it was too early to move to PRs but on the other hand it is the only way to really show the implications and feasibility of the suggestion. It is quite slow to work with the sparse, and occasionally inconsistent ;), feedback. I'd be happy to set up a Hangouts session to discuss details and options directly!\n> I think best option is to add support for (non iterated over) constants in RNN as per the original solution in this PR: 28795f1 This way we keep down the number of classes, and for implementing attention we just need to wrap/implement the RNN cell.\r\n\r\nI've been looking at these PRs for some time and I'm still not sure. It would definitely be helpful to have more people chime in with their perspective.\r\n\r\nI think you're probably right, it would be good to add `constants` to the `RNN` API. One thing to consider though, is that `keras.backend.rnn` already has support for `constants`. It would be good not to reimplement an independent, layer-level mechanism, and instead reuse what we have...\r\n\r\nIf we do this, the API changes would be:\r\n\r\n- `constants=None` in `RNN`'s `call`. Ideally this would forward the constants to `K.rnn` (they are then appended to the first argument passed to the step function).\r\n- `SequenceAttention` wrapper class for RNN cells? (please confirm)\r\n\r\n> In this case, I can't come up with a better name then constants\r\n\r\n`constants` is fine.\r\n\n> It would be good not to reimplement an independent, layer-level mechanism, and instead reuse what we have...\r\n\r\nBesides just the semantic problem of having multiple similar but independent mechanisms with the same name, one thing to consider is performance. Different backends might want to optimize the way they manage constants. Theano does it to some extent, for instance.\r\n\nLet's see... how bad would it be to have something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass RNN(...):\r\n\r\ndef __call__(self, inputs, initial_state=None, constants=None, **kwargs):\r\n       # handle connectivity of `constants`, like we do for `initial_state`\r\n       ...\r\n\r\ndef call(self, inputs, mask=None, training=None, initial_state=None, constants=None):\r\n        ...\r\n        if constants:\r\n            if not has_arg(self.cell.call, 'constants'):\r\n                 raise ValueError(...)\r\n            def step(inputs, states):\r\n                 constants = inputs[1:]\r\n                 if has_arg(self.cell.call, 'training'):\r\n                     return self.cell.call(inputs[0], constants=constants, training=training)\r\n                 else:\r\n                     return self.cell.call(inputs[0], constants=constants)\r\n           \r\n        last_output, outputs, states = K.rnn(step,\r\n                                             inputs,\r\n                                             initial_state,\r\n                                             go_backwards=self.go_backwards,\r\n                                             mask=mask,\r\n                                             constants=constants,\r\n                                             unroll=self.unroll,\r\n                                             input_length=timesteps)\r\n```\nGood, at this point it seems obvious that we should add `constants` support to `layer.RNN`. It will be backward compatible and \"non-advanced\" users don't have to even now that it's there.\r\n   \r\n> It would be good not to reimplement an independent, layer-level mechanism, and instead reuse what we have...\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean by this, but yes it's important that `Layer` level API is consistent (in terminology and functionality) with the `backend` level, to the extent possible/meaningful. That is a good motivation to stick to the same name and behaviour for `constants`.\r\n\r\n> Besides just the semantic problem of having multiple similar but independent mechanisms with the same name [...]\r\n\r\nI don't think there is anything strange about having a layer `RNN` that to a great extent \"duplicates\" functionality of backend `rnn`. I think it is clear what the layer level \"brings to the table\" (initialisation, building, holding weights...). Backend `rnn` is the purer (subset) of `RNN` functionality that is backend dependent.\r\n\r\n> [...] one thing to consider is performance. Different backends might want to optimize the way they manage constants. Theano does it to some extent, for instance.\r\n\r\nYes, this is important and quite complex. I wrote about it in my previous comments and put a note on it in the PR (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/7980/files#diff-3118e4e28157032506f771f279a551c3R2340). I agree that its better to pass constants to backend `rnn` and let it explicitly pass them to the `step_function` (rather then partialising step_function with them), but regarding optimisation I'm not sure that is \"enough\" or makes a big difference anyway. For Theano we should actually pass all involved tensors in the step transformation, _including the weights_, as `non_sequences` to `theano.scan`. This is not done/supported with current API. I haven't profiled how big difference it makes for typical applications.\r\n\r\n> Let's see... how bad would it be to have something like: [...]\r\n\r\nThis is not too bad - it's one way of making sure that the constants are passed via backend `rnn`. There is a bug though: you assume `constants` are appended to `inputs` inside `rnn` but in fact they are appended to `states` (see e.g.: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/keras/backend/tensorflow_backend.py#L2479). Note that this appending of constants is not documented in any of the backends' `rnn`. CNTK has no docs, Theano and Tensorflow backends don't mention what happens with constants and are in fact wrong when stating:\r\n\r\n>  `new_states: list of tensors, same length and shapes as 'states'`\r\n\r\nWhere `'states'` refers to the argument of the `step_function`. This is not true if constants are passed to `rnn` as if so: `len(new_states) < len(states)`.\r\n   \r\nI think this mistake is symptomatic of one of the issues with the Keras recurrent code base - _that arguments are not always what they \"claim to be\" - and will be different things at different times_: \"states can be either states - or states and constants\" and \"inputs can be either inputs - or inputs and initial_state\" (in `RNN.__call__`) This causes mental overhead, boilerplate for splitting lists of inputs and decreased readability.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend working towards removing this pattern. We should try to make `step_function`in backend `rnn` reflect the RNNCell in `RNN` and I think there should be a separate argument for constants (not append them to states as is done now, or inputs as would be required in your code example) - this goes for the `step_function` as well as `cell.call`. It is more clear and easier to extend this way. This is easy to change but would not be backward compatible in terms of backend `rnn`'s expectations on `step_function` (although, as mentioned above, its not part of API documentation how `constants` are passed to `step_function`). What's your thoughts on this, could we change signature to `step_function(inputs, states, constants=None)` and make it mirror the RNNCell?\r\n\r\nThe other example, that `inputs` to `RNN` can be either just the input tensor or a list of the input _and_ `initial_state`, gets more complicated if we add yet another keyword argument `constants` to `RNN.__call__` that could also be part of `inputs`. If `inputs`is a list of say two tensors, how can we know if the second one is `intitial_state`or `constants` (especially if `state_spec` and `constant_spec`happen to be the same)? Is this really required, is it not possible to allow passing `initial_state` (and later `constants`)  _only_ by keyword arg? I get that is has to do with composing (and serialisation?) of models, I haven't looked into the details but there should be a better solution...\r\n\n> one of the issues with the Keras recurrent code base - that arguments are not always what they \"claim to be\" - and will be different things at different times: \r\n\r\nThe specific cases you list arise from one simple problem: topology management requires us to normalize all call signatures to a standard signature where all tensor inputs are in the first argument, as a flat list. However, good API design sometimes requires dedicated keyword arguments for some inputs (`initial_state`, `constants`). Hence the need to have a conversion layer between what's user-facing (the keyword args) and the internal representation (single flat list of inputs). This is purely internal code and it's fine to have it.\nSure, I haven't looked into the details, but it would have been better with support for _named_ links in the topology, based on naming of args. When I call:\r\n```\r\nlstm = LSTM(...)\r\ny = lstm(x, initial_state=[h, c])\r\n```\r\n I'd have expected `lstm.inputs` to return something like `{'inputs': <tf.Tensor ...>, 'initial_state': [<tf.Tensor ...>, <tf.Tensor ...>]}` and same structure for `lstm.inbound_nodes[0].inbound_layers`.\nTo proceed, there are two things from past discussions I'd like to get confirmed:\r\n\r\n1) Is it part of the (functional) API that you should be able to pass `initial_states` as part of `inputs` (instead of using the keyword argument) _first time_ the RNN layer is called? And do we want the same behaviour for the new argument `constants`?\r\n\r\nFor example should you, first time calling a LSTM, be able to do this:\r\n```y = lstm([x, h_init, c_init])```,\r\nand should you be able to, first time calling an attentive lstm, do this:\r\n```y = att_lstm([x, z])```,\r\nas well as: \r\n```y = att_lstm([x, h_init, c_init, z])```.\r\nAnd for the case of multiple constants (attended):\r\n```y = att_lstm([x, z1, z2])```,\r\nas well as:\r\n```y = att_lstm([x, h_init, c_init, z1, z2])```\r\n\r\nIf so, _inferring_ what `inputs` actually contains (in `RNN.__call__`) gets complicated. To support all corner cases, an attentive cell would have to _declare_ how many constants it expects (to make it possible for RNN to split inputs and know if it contains initial states as well) which is otherwise not needed. I emphasise _first time_ in my question because (I think) as long as you used the keyword argument `constants` first time calling the `RNN` you can store what's expected in e.g. a property `constants_spec` (default to `None`) to allow general splitting of inputs if called again. But it gets a bit messy anyhow (hence my \"wish\" in previous comment).\r\n\r\n2) Can we change expected signature of `step_function` in backend `rnn` to:\r\n```step_funtion(inputs, states, [constants])```\r\n(where constants are only expected if constants are passed to `rnn`) to reflect how we want `RNNCell.call` signature?\r\n\r\nI can't see any reason why we append `constants` to `states` inside `rnn`, this case is not motivated by \"flat list\" requirements from Topology linking. (If completely ignoring legacy, I'd rename `step_function -> cell_function` as well). However, I do realise that this breaks the expected (even if not documented) behaviour of `rnn`. If we don't change this, it will result in an inconsistency in how constants are handled in `RNN <-> cell` vs `rnn <-> step_function`. If it is not an option to change signature of `step_function`, _I think it is still better to accept this inconsistency, rather than enforcing the \"unmotivated appending of constants to states\" in_ `RNNCell.call` (the different signatures can be \"bridged\" inside `RNN` in this case, similar to your previous suggestion).\r\n\n> _I think it is still better to accept this inconsistency, rather than enforcing the \"unmotivated appending of constants to states\" in_ `RNNCell.call`\r\n\r\nPlease trust me on this one; it will _destroy_ readability of Attention Mechanisms and cause a lot of implementation overhead when trying to make them modular if we start mixing `states` and `constants` in the same list.\nYes, passing all input tensors as a flat list is part of the internal API. On the user-facing side of things, we can always avoid doing that (and instead pass the additional arguments as keyword arguments), but it is unavoidable at model deserialization time.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's difficult to figure out a reasonable way to parse the list of inputs. Since the problem only occurs at deserialization time, it should be possible to store in the layer config whether or not initial states and constants are \"keras tensors\" (i.e. whether they are part of the model topology), which would then provide all the information needed for deserialization.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that this is an implementation detail. The public API is still to use keyword arguments.\r\n\r\n\n> Please trust me on this one; it will destroy readability of Attention Mechanisms \r\n\r\nIt is purely an implementation detail and will not modify the signatures of the `call` methods of either batch-level layers or cells. Hence no readability problem. We should do it, both for performance reasons and conceptual simplicity. See the earlier code snippet for an implementation suggestion.\n> I'm not sure I understood the answer to (2.), is my understanding correct that we should not change expected signature of (backend rnn argument) step_function? But instead just wrap cell.call inside RNN?\r\n\r\nYes, indeed, we can simply wrap the calls to the step function, as in the code snippet.\r\n\r\nYour other comment: my quote on readability means to say that since method signatures don't change, the implementation of `call` is strictly the same. Hence is it not less readable: it is identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR raises several specific implementation concerns regarding the handling of constants in the recurrent layer, particularly relating to the `__call__` method. The constants should be treated as genuine inputs, akin to how the `initial_state` is approached, ensuring clarity in API use. Breaking the norm of passing all layer inputs in `__call__` could lead to confusion. \n\nThe suggestion to inject the attended sequence into the cell's initialization (e.g., `cell.attended = attended_sequence`) is discouraged, as it complicates the API while offering no clear advantage. Instead, the preferred approach is to integrate constants into the `RNN` class, allowing backward compatibility without adding unnecessary complexity. This would also align with the existing backend functionality, promoting consistency. There is consensus that an explicit term like `constants` for these inputs would enhance clarity, with discussions ongoing about the correct handling of input parsing during deserialization. Additionally, the relationship between states and constants needs careful definition to avoid appending them together, which would reduce modularity and readability in attention implementations."

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment highlights significant implementation adjustments and questions concerning function design and testing. The code was refactored to consolidate separate functions into a single function to mitigate fragility and code duplication. The introduction of an `axis` parameter resolved discrepancies with `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel`. The initial decision to retain distinct functions stemmed from testing requirements in the TensorFlow repo, though this was reconsidered. The change to use `parameterized.named_parameters()` for testing improves structure, but there was a noted challenge using `named_product()` due to the need for expected value specifications. Concerns arose regarding the necessity of keeping `fake_quant_with_min_max_args` and `fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel`, which were ultimately removed. Additionally, there are ongoing issues with tests failing on JAX with GPU due to lower precision, warranting careful evaluation but deemed minimal in practical impact. Further revisions may be required pending CI results."

Also, Travis is green including the [LSTM test](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/tests/keras/layers/test_recurrent.py#L111). I wonder how our systems differ. Are you using the master branch of Theano from their git repo or the PyPI build? Could you share the exact code that causes the errors so I can try to reproduce it?\n\nInteresting. Both Travis and my system use the latest master branch of Theano. I'll try with the PyPI release now to see if that causes problems.\n\nBy the way, the speedup on CPU seems significant too (around 15%), but I'd like to run more trials to average hardware warmup out to be extra sure.\n\n**Average run times per epoch on `imdb_bidirectional_lstm.py`:**\n- 57.5 seconds with `consume_less='derp'`\n- 67.5 seconds with `consume_less='cpu'`\n- 67.75 seconds with `consume_less='mem'`\n\nAlright, fixed. Try it now please.\n\nDropout is passed to `step()` as standard Python lists and not tensors, which I did not expect.\n\nAs it stands a limitation of doing two large GEMMs is that the same dropout will be used for all gates but this could probably be remedied. Ideas welcome.\n\n[The forget gate initialization is also wrong at the moment](https://github.com/carlthome/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/recurrent.py#L653) as its all zeros. It would be an easy fix if the backend supported subtensor assignment as suggested by https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/2093. Other ideas also welcome.\n\nBy the way, there is no unit test for RNN dropout.\n\nI think these errors are resulted by parallel issue. I may spend some time revising a better `test_image.py`. You probably can submit it again and hope the error won't happen again.\n\n> As it stands a limitation of doing two large GEMMs is that the same dropout will be used for all gates but this could probably be remedied. Ideas welcome.\n\nyep - I spotted that as well. I played with this approach a bit some time ago, and I think it leads to slightly worse performance. Is there a way to do the large GEMM with different masks for the 4 gates? A naive approach would be to zero out parts of the rows of the large matrix, but there might be a more efficient way of doing this.\n\n@yaringal, would it really result in the same result though? The B_W mask would have four times as many coin flips than B_W[0] so at least each gate's weights would be masked differently, right? Or maybe I'm just misunderstanding the matrix multiplication dimensions. Anyway, regarding having all batch points getting the same mask though, yeah...\n\nStill, **a GPU performance increase of roughly 40%** at the expense of requiring the same RNN dropout for all gates is useful in many cases, especially considering many don't even use dropout, and considering some might be looking to [RNN batch normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01378) in the future. **I propose merging a third `consume_less` mode** (renamed to something better than derp of course, maybe `consume_less='time'`? :joy: ), properly documented to mention that all gates must share dropout. Memory usage remains the same, and there's even a slight CPU performance increase (roughly 15%). This is all in line with Theano's manual (which was likely written before @yaringal's paper).\n\nI'd like the forget_bias_init to be set properly first though. Preferably with this https://github.com/fchollet/keras/pull/2093 but optionally by allowing K.concatenate() with a name.\n\n> I'd like the forget_bias_init to be set properly first though. \n\nThis is easy, tensor initialization is done via Numpy arrays of initial values.\n\n> Why not make it part of consume_less='cpu'? What would be the downsides?\n\n@fchollet, the downside is that you couldn't use the exactly correct RNN dropout, but rather might get worsened regularization (and possibly other side effects) because all gates need to share the same dropout, because of the GEMM concatenation.\n\n> This is easy, tensor initialization is done via Numpy arrays of initial values.\n\nAlright, I'll readd the forget_bias_init tomorrow just like that.\n\n> Also, if there a significant speed up on GPU but not on CPU, consume_less='gpu' would be a user-friendly mode name. By the way, it would be great to test it on more networks / tasks to see how the speed-up fares across a range of problems.\n\n`consume_less='gpu'` sounds good. I think there might be some value to keeping the previous two modes, because of the dropout, but I guess it really should come down to what @yaringal quantifies in his experiments. Maybe it doesn't make much of a real-world difference?\n\n@carlthome I ran a LM model experiment using Zaremba et al. (2014)'s large model setting (Pen Treebank with 2 layer LSTM, 1250 units in each layer) with the two dropout variants: 1) current implementation (each gate using different masks), 2) tied masks (using a large matrix product and a single dropout mask for each input - `K.dot(x * B_W[0], self.W)` with W=[W1; W2; W3; W4]). I repeated each experiment 3 times with different random seeds. \nI got: \n- 79.14+-0.18 validation perplexity and 76.28+-0.33 test perplexity for setting 1\n- 79.36+-0.11 validation perplexity and 76.75+-0.15 test perplexity for setting 2\n- (this is in comparison to Zaremba et al.'s 82.2 validation perplexity and 78.4 test perplexity)\n\nI'd say the difference is statistically significant but negligible, so either one can be used. \nBtw, if you're interested in the theoretical interpretation of setting 2, it simply corresponds to a different approximating distribution structure. I'll add these results to the arXiv paper.\n\nAdded an example showcasing the difference between `consume_less` modes.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1595907/15003577/72bbf01c-11ad-11e6-9fcc-61653fd9ad1e.png)\nOne could certainly wonder why I managed to pick hyperparameters that lead to increasing validation loss, but I was more concerned with showcasing computational performance.  :dancer:  \n\nI thought about including RAM and CPU load with psutils but profiling is a bit of a hassle (multi-threading, at the very least) and I don't know if it's smart to introduce new external dependencies just for an example. Also, profiling GPUs is almost impossible since there is no clear hardware-agnostic solution out there. Best to leave this up to each user.\n\nFinally, I think it's a little weird to call it `consume_less='gpu'` when it's really quite the opposite and actually is managing to consume more GPU resources (which is a good thing), but I don't have any other suggestions.\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR discussion raises several key concerns regarding the implementation of RNN dropout and the GEMM processes, particularly under Theano and TensorFlow backends. Notably, there's a `ValueError` linked to inconsistent dimensionality of `outputs_info` and the inner function in Theano’s `scan`. It suggests using `dimshuffle` or `shape_padleft` to rectify initial state dimensionality. TensorFlow errors indicate dropout being passed as Python lists instead of tensors, complicating gate-wise dropout application. The proposal to implement a third `consume_less` mode—provisionally named `consume_less='time'`—is supported, ensuring consistent performance while sharing dropout across gates. The need to correctly initialize the forget bias is identified as a prerequisite for merging this feature. It’s recommended to test various network types to ensure the efficacy of the GPU speedup and overall functionality across different settings. Additionally, the lack of unit tests for RNN dropout is highlighted as a critical oversight."

I'll add documentations to how batch_dot works. It is unique to Keras. Its neither T.tensordot nor tf.batch_matmul \n\nAnd this rises another question: where should I document backend functions?

Specifically, I ported my Inception-v3 architecture to the new functional API and it's taking a long time to construct the model. Haven't profiled, but from the stack trace when I killed it, it looks like all the time is being spent in `build_map_of_graph`.\n\nCan we cache somehow? IIRC, this was the solution to the performance issues when I constructed this model with the Graph API.\n\nFYI I tried stacking 4 regular inception modules, and the time take by model instantiation (of which `build_map_of_graph` is part) was 0.002s. I can give a shot at reimplementing inceptionv3, but really it would be faster to see your code.\n\nHere's the gist: https://gist.github.com/neggert/f8b86d001a367aa7dde1ab6b587246b5\n\nI may have been a bit quick on the trigger with posting. It ends up taking ~15 minutes to construct the model, which is still less than the ~1 hour it takes to compile with Theano. So I'm not sure how much of an issue this is.\n\nI do have some questions about what \"depth\" means in this model, since many nodes will have different depths along different paths. But I guess as long as it works...\n\nBTW, great work on the functional API. This is so much cleaner than the implementation I have using `Graph`.\n\nHmm. I removed batch norm and here's what I get (everything under Theano):\n\n```\n488.622755051 s to make model\n70.1582930088 s to compile\n```\n\nAnd here it was with BN:\n\n```\n893.500264168 s to make model\n503.544885159 s to compile\n```\n\n(It turns out that I either mis-remembered how long it took to compile or keras-1 somehow speeds up the compile)\n\nSo BN is a pretty significant contributor. I do think that the number of calls to `build_map_of_graph` will scale with the number of paths, which grows roughly geometrically with the number of layers. So you may actually need to implement the full thing to actually see the problem.\n\nedit: Oh, and weight decay and L2 weight regularization [are the same thing](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/gettingstarted.html#l1-and-l2-regularization), right?\n\n> or keras-1 somehow speeds up the compile\n\nIt does, because the training graph and testing graph are now a single graph instead of two separate graphs.\n\n>  Oh, and weight decay and L2 weight regularization are the same thing, right?\n\nNot necessarily. Another way to do weight decay is to multiply weights by `1 - decay` at every update, rather than adding `decay * L2(weights)` to the loss function (which is what the Keras L2 regularizer does). I am wondering what is meant by weight decay in inception v3.\n\n> So you may actually need to implement the full thing to actually see the problem.\n\nI'll try. BTW I pushed some changes to `build_map_of_graph`; although I don't think there should be any significant impact, you can try timing again with the new version.\n",

This more focus on make user easily to user their own sandbox image.\n@li-boxuan \r\nHi, I ran into trouble during unit testing. The error message indicates that the package was not installed, and I'm not sure if it's because I used the system's default pip. I also don't know how to run it locally. Could you give me some help? \r\nhttps://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/actions/runs/9538712667/job/26288240253?pr=2101\r\n\n> The error message indicates that the package was not installed, and I'm not sure if it's because I used the system's default pip\r\n\r\nThe test, `test_ipython_module`, tests whether OpenDevin could install a python module in the sandbox. From the log it looks like OpenDevin couldn't install a python module using your branch. Specifically, it could install the package, but couldn't import it.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce it on your branch:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npoetry run python opendevin/core/main.py -c CodeActSWEAgent -t \"Install and import pymsgbox==1.0.9 and print it's version in /workspace/test.txt. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"846\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/assets/25746010/37a24d71-906c-40ec-8932-29e27edc2045\">\r\n\n@li-boxuan @xingyaoww @yufansong \r\nThank you very much for your help! I found the root cause of the issue: under the root user, pip points to `/opendevin/miniforge3/bin/pip` (because `/opendevin/miniforge3/bin` was added to the PATH in the Dockerfile), while under the opendevin user, pip points to `/usr/bin/pip`. This causes the opendevin user to use the system environment's pip when installing packages, which is why it doesn't work as expected.\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\n# ==== OpenDevin Runtime Client ====\r\nRUN mkdir -p /opendevin && mkdir -p /opendevin/logs && chmod 777 /opendevin/logs\r\nRUN wget \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\r\nRUN bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh -b -p /opendevin/miniforge3\r\nRUN bash -c \". /opendevin/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda config --set changeps1 False && conda config --append channels conda-forge\"\r\n\r\n# this\r\nRUN echo \"export PATH=/opendevin/miniforge3/bin:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, I found a feasible solution: write the common configuration, such as PATH, into the global bashrc file. Modify the Dockerfile to change `echo \"export PATH=/opendevin/miniforge3/bin:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc` to `echo \"export PATH=/opendevin/miniforge3/bin:$PATH\" >> /etc/bash.bashrc`, and then before each plugin loads, run `source /etc/bash.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`. This way, every user can recognize the correct pip path.\r\n\r\nIt has an additional benefit: it automatically points `python` to `/opendevin/miniforge3/bin/python` without any special setup. This way, using python in `setup.sh` will utilize `/opendevin/miniforge3/bin/python`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass PluginMixin:\r\n    \"\"\"Mixin for Sandbox to support plugins.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def _source_bashrc(self):\r\n        exit_code, output = self.execute('source /etc/bash.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc')\r\n        if exit_code != 0:\r\n            raise RuntimeError(\r\n                f'Failed to source ~/.bashrc with exit code {exit_code} and output: {output}'\r\n            )\r\n        logger.info('Sourced ~/.bashrc successfully')\r\n\r\n    def init_plugins(self: SandboxProtocol, requirements: list[PluginRequirement]):\r\n        \"\"\"Load a plugin into the sandbox.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n        if hasattr(self, 'plugin_initialized') and self.plugin_initialized:\r\n            return\r\n\r\n        if self.initialize_plugins:\r\n            logger.info('Initializing plugins in the sandbox')\r\n\r\n            # clean-up ~/.bashrc and touch ~/.bashrc\r\n            exit_code, output = self.execute('rm -f ~/.bashrc && touch ~/.bashrc')\r\n\r\n            for requirement in requirements:\r\n                self._source_bashrc()\r\n            ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have any good suggestions?\n> Whether this two source will result some env variable overlap.\r\n\r\nI think the later `bashrc` can always override the base one - we probably need to assume for plugins maintainers to get this right and we have unit tests in place so I'm not too worried?\r\n\r\n> etc/bash.bashrc Do you have any other better place to save the global bash file?\r\n\r\nMaybe like `/opendevin/bash.bashrc` so everything opendevin related is under `/opendevin`?\r\n\r\n> When other user bring their sandbox image, how to remind them take care of this point that we will also do another initilization.\r\n\r\nI think is actually fine - it is just the default python is in `/opendevin/miniforge3` and only `od-runtime-cli` is dependent on that, people can feel free to switch to other environments in `bash` if they would like to develop in another env.\nAs @xingyaoww mentioned, I agree with placing enviroment in `/opendevin/bash.bashrc`.\r\n\r\nI believe one of our design principles is to minimize the intrusiveness of opendevin, avoiding disruption to the system's original environment and instead isolating a separate environment for opendevin's use. Therefore, using `/opendevin/bash.bashrc` instead of `/etc/bash.bashrc` is preferable.\r\n\r\nBased on this principle, we can place common environment variables in `/opendevin/bash.bashrc` rather than intruding into the user's original bashrc file. At the same time, we won't modify the system's original user's Python; instead, we will specify the Python to be used by sourcing the environment variables in the code when needed. This approach ensures that when users call Python, it still points to the system's original Python (`/usr/bin/python`). In summary, we can make opendevin a pluggable software, ensuring that it does not adversely affect the original environment.\r\n\r\nI plan to create a PR to add environment variables to `/opendevin/bash.bashrc` in the Dockerfile. After the new PR is merged, I will modify this PR to load the environment variables from `/opendevin/bash.bashrc`, thereby accommodating both the root and opendevin users. Finally, I will remove the PATH in `/root/.bashrc` to ensure it does not affect the original container environment.\n@Shimada666 Seems CI failed due to the same reason. Did it work for you locally?\r\n\r\nYou could either run\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npoetry run python opendevin/core/main.py -c CodeActSWEAgent -t \"Install and import pymsgbox==1.0.9 and print it's version in /workspace/test.txt. Do not ask me for confirmation at any point.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(not recommended as LLM response could be non-deterministic),\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nTEST_ONLY=true ONLY_TEST_AGENT=CodeActSWEAgent ONLY_TEST_NAME=test_ipython_module ./tests/integration/regenerate.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n(recommended as this would reproduce the issue in the CI test).\r\n\n@li-boxuan \r\n\r\nyes, I can reproduce this error locally. The current code fails under the opendevin user. As mentioned above, I understand the reason for the error. \r\nNext, I will make some modifications to adapt to the opendevin user. After the modifications are complete, the integration tests should pass.\n> Now all CI tests are passed, I am ready to be reviewed again!\r\n\r\nI can't review all the sandbox topics myself, I'll leave that to others.\r\nBut still would like to ask to only cause downloads if tests are run in CI on the server.\r\n\r\nMaybe add a test fixture `.skipif` (see other tests) that could skip the test if `TEST_IN_CI` is not true?\r\nYou may find examples in the `test_agent.py` for that.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```py\r\n@pytest.mark.skipif(os.getenv('TEST_IN_CI') != 'true',\r\n    reason='Only run on CI',\r\n)\r\n```",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR highlights several technical concerns focused on the integration with `sshd` and Docker image handling for the `OpenDevin` project. The current method of including `sshd` by modifying the entry point is not universally applicable, as it doesn't accommodate CentOS, which requires `yum`. A proposed architectural change suggests abandoning SSH in favor of WebSocket communication and allowing users to supply base images for Dockerfile generation.\n\nFurther implementation suggestions include creating a Dockerfile builder to manage dependencies like `mamba` and `sshd`, ensuring sandbox-agnostic functionality. The PR also refines the Python runtime setup by utilizing Miniforge and addresses issues where package installations fail for the `opendevin` user due to pip path discrepancies. To improve user experience, a new bashrc file placement strategy under `/opendevin` is suggested to minimize system intrusiveness.\n\nConcrete actions include modifying the Dockerfile to write environment variables to `/opendevin/bash.bashrc` and ensuring CI tests only trigger downloads during server execution. Lastly, unit tests should verify the new sandbox image behavior, addressing the issue of utilizing images built within the current PR context."

There are also more tests that I [separated](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/7226) out, that I keep an eye on, and they went well!\r\n\r\n(~I'll make another pass renaming the new events as Robert suggested on slack, but that won't change anything of substance.~ Done.)\r\n\r\nI'd love to get this in, and then Calvin and I are looking into maybe doing something similar for the condenser summaries, or at least, [it has become clear to us](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/7175#issuecomment-2722416008) that it is a similar problem: just like `repo.md` gets \"lost\" from context sometimes after runtime errors or something, the condenser summaries can get lost, and that's why we see that strange agent behavior doing again what it did before.\n> (Though I kinda still like the more generalized \"RecallAction\" better -- because environment info fits a bit awkward in \"MicroagentObservation\" and can be confusing to display in the UI -- I would consider it is more like \"PromptExtensionAction/Observation\"\r\n\r\nIt is a bit strange! I almost stopped at half in the renaming process to think it over, because the LLM interpreted the MicroagentObservation as \"the output of a MicroagentAction\", which sounds like the microagent _acted_... That's the same confusion that existed because of the old microagents when people expected the new ones to \"act\" like the old ones.\r\n\r\nThese events, IMHO, are _about information retrieval_: we found the content of a microagent or more, and published it in the stream. Or runtime info, yes!\r\n\r\nMicroagents can be interpreted as a particular format in which a RecallObservation can find/bring information.\r\n\r\nOr, as you said, we could look at the end result (we do this so that eventually they're added to the context), so PromptExtensions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I can see maybe arguments for it:\r\n- we have a similar pattern with DelegateAction and DelegateObservation: the events belong to the parent. That works. So maybe it's perfectly fine, not confusing in that way\r\n- the events already include attributes that say \"microagent\", so it was `RecallObservation` with `RecallType` `MICROAGENT_KNOWLEDGE`, and a list of little dataclasses `MicroagentKnowledge`, which is maybe... half this style, half that style? I feel like, it wasn't actually generic yet, and it seems like it would affect a PromptExtension name too...\r\n- Robert got positive feedback on the name \"microagent\", maybe it will be good to double down on it for now 😄 \r\n\r\n(The 'environment' type is an enum value, maybe the UI can pick it up and do something a bit special about that type...)\r\n\r\nIdk, the near future does seem to bring more about microagents (e.g. we can maybe handle `TASK` in a follow-up, custom global directory, retrieving library docs from the internet could be mapped to microagents - I suppose?), so I think maybe it's okay to test it and see where it leads us.\r\n\r\nCc: @rbren ",

Key tasks include backporting these changes without incorporating `RecallObservations` or altering `prompt_manager.py`. It’s crucial to focus solely on the last two commits for accuracy.\n\nAnother significant area of focus is the failure of \"RT Unit Tests\" connected to replay functionality, necessitating an analysis of runtime tests and potential adjustments to pending actions or trajectory files. The task requires creating a dedicated branch `replay-fixes` for iterative fixes.\n\nAdditionally, discussions around naming convention suggest renaming `MicroagentObservation` to better convey its purpose in information retrieval, reflecting on the clarity of associated attributes. Ongoing revisions are expected to improve semantic clarity and operational consistency."

It'd be great if we could also get the condensation trigger behavior to be token-count aware, even if we're just approximating it. With enough of a safety factor we might be able to avoid context window errors entirely.\r\n\r\n> I am still to check your latest changes, I think we may want to sync at least on what kind of Action do we want here, it kinda matters for the rest IMHO.\r\n\r\nMy first pass had different events for each kind of condenser, because they wanted slightly different bits of information. The current approach just has a single event with the union of all those features. I'd love to have some kind of \"payload polymorphism\" so that even with a single event there's still some type-safety, but the current event implementation makes that pretty fiddly. Might revisit that after a little event clean-up.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, I've got all existing tests working and have confirmed condensation happens appropriately without disrupting the agent flow. There's still some clean-up needed on documentation, and I want to add more tests, but I'm decently happy with where this PR is now.\nRe:\r\n> running scripts on eval trajectories has slowed to a crawl\r\n> some simplification there\r\n\r\nI'm pondering at least these two optimizations:\r\n- https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/7398\r\n- https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/7404\r\n\nThere might be two areas where we can tweak a bit:\r\n- we should save in the stream data necessary for the agent, but I hesitate whether we should now save data that is useful for external scripts/evals. I think usually we've been using the State pickle instead.\r\n- some logic could maybe be moved to conversation_memory, in theory it's its job to figure out the events in history and make up from them the context for the LLM. Such refactoring may help to make the code a bit more obvious here.\r\n\r\nI think the second could be in a follow-up, the first however seems important to me because the event stream is saved on user machines, and we care about compatibility afaik. We are able to load relatively old streams seamlessly (usually). Idk, this one would be more difficult to change later.\n> * we should save in the stream data necessary for the agent, but I hesitate whether we should now save data that is useful for external scripts/evals. I think usually we've been using the State pickle instead.\r\n\r\nI agree we shouldn't have loads of extra data saved in the event stream. The `Condenser` base class already implements a metadata mechanism that lets the implementing classes call `self.add_metadata` and have the arguments registered in the `State` object.\r\n\r\nThe only bit of info being added here that isn't crucial is the `considered_event_ids` field (and maybe the `condenser_cls` field, but that'll be used when I update the agent controller's context truncation). I included it for two reasons:\r\n1. It fully captures the semantics of the condensation event -- even if the implementation of a condenser changes, we can use that extra information to unambiguously reconstruct histories from old versions.\r\n2. It acts as a \"checksum\" in case the event stream gets messed up.\r\n\r\n1 is definitely a personal preference, and 2 is probably an imagined issue. LMK and I will remove the field.\r\n\r\n> * some logic could maybe be moved to conversation_memory, in theory it's its job to figure out the events in history and make up from them the context for the LLM. Such refactoring may help to make the code a bit more obvious here.\r\n\r\nI'll have to think about that a bit, it'd be good to avoid complex back-and-forth between the conversation memory and the condenser. Agreed that there's plenty of room to refactor here (and I expect I'll be doing some very shortly).\nI've been thinking about this kind of case we have here, when we did Recall. The problem is familiar to you: we have a case of discriminated union, and no much underlying support for it in the current codebase. Like here, there we had RecallObservations, with two subtypes, `workspace_context` and `knowledge`, and a few more upcoming, e.g. `task` or `library_docs`.\r\n\r\nI played with potential solutions, and the one that fit best IMHO was a class hierarchy, and the serialization done manually with a discriminator enum field (serialized as Recall, not as subtypes). If or when we migrate events from dataclasses to pydantic, it would've been probably painless on this aspect.\r\n\r\nHowever, that kind of solution hit a problem: the event stream is flat. Mostly flat. Some composition is used, but even that not a lot, and some of it was due to external complexity I think. The similar case was FileRead IIRC. As you know, eventually Recall is flattened: a single observation class, with a `recall_type`, and right from the start, when created/deserialized, only one set of attrs is chosen. \r\n(that is, the subtypes remain unnamed/implicit) 🤔\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for writing on the run, but I want to submit it for you to consider, because I think maybe such approach could be suited here too?\nThis is a good discussion! Just a quick note on this:\r\n\r\n> we should save in the stream data necessary for the agent, but I hesitate whether we should now save data that is useful for external scripts/evals\r\n\r\nI think the event stream typically should hold information that's necessary for the agent, or also the human communicating with the agent. \"considered_event_ids\" seems like it's actually something that could be very useful for the human to trace what sort of information was considered in the summary (we could even surface it in the UI somehow), so I would vote in favor of keeping this as-is.\r\n\r\n(separately, practically we'd like to finish up these condenser changes soon so we can turn condensation on by default soon, so whichever way we go it'd be good to make a timely decision!)\n> > we should save in the stream data necessary for the agent, but I hesitate whether we should now save data that is useful for external scripts/evals\r\n> \r\n> I think the event stream typically should hold information that's necessary for the agent, or also the human communicating with the agent. \"considered_event_ids\" seems like it's actually something that could be very useful for the human to trace what sort of information was considered in the summary (we could even surface it in the UI somehow), so I would vote in favor of keeping this as-is.\r\n\r\nI hear you, my point here is just that we already have it, from a simpler structure. The events that were summarized are `history[start_id..end_id]` or `history[keep_first...end_id]` I think.\r\n\r\nSo it looks to me like maybe we don't exactly _need_ to save the intermediary ids too.\r\n\r\n> (separately, practically we'd like to finish up these condenser changes soon so we can turn condensation on by default soon, so whichever way we go it'd be good to make a timely decision!)\r\n\r\nI think condenser is on by default already, isn't it?\r\n\r\nWith you on figuring it out sooner either way. I actually started working on this problem in https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/7311 , then Calvin started too, from the other \"end\", then had to do the same thing 7311 did, so there was some duplicate work, which probably doesn't help a lot with timing, but it's also hard to avoid when we need a complete implementation so that we can check that it solves the bug it meant to solve.\r\n\r\nI'm giving it a try on a test event stream. \n> The only bit of info being added here that isn't crucial is the `considered_event_ids` field (and maybe the `condenser_cls` field, but that'll be used when I update the agent controller's context truncation).\r\n\r\nThere is also `forgotten_ids`, or am I missing something? As far as I can tell, and please correct me if wrong, for all except LLM_ATTENTION, this field holds a list that we can, alternatively, compute from much less information (start, end; a slice of history).\r\n\r\nI can see why we could also do this one for all, since we have to do it for one. I'm not fully sure though, with event streams of 3k+ events, that's a lot of info to send via the websocket, even, every step, and of course to save and to parse? 🤔 \r\n\r\nI'd love your thoughts on #7526 , as minimal (-ish) alternative. Could it have, or maybe it doesn't have all we actually need?\r\n\r\n> > * some logic could maybe be moved to conversation_memory, in theory it's its job to figure out the events in history and make up from them the context for the LLM.

Agreed that there's plenty of room to refactor here (and I expect I'll be doing some very shortly).\r\n\r\nI think one way to look at it is that the condenser is included in the \"responsibility\" of conversation_memory in a sense: not how it's doing things, that's mostly its thing, but what does the history sent to the LLM ends up having. That interface between the condenser and the agent could be actually an interface between condenser and conversation_memory (e.g. just include the call to condenser in `process_events` to begin with, it may help us think through the next steps?) \r\n\r\nMaybe then we see the next step could be that we don't need to return `events` from the condensers, we only need `AgentCondensationAction | None` ?\nLots of good feedback here, thanks you two. I'll try and address the points made, but TL;DR I'd like to get this merged and resolve those concerns in future PRs if possible.\r\n\r\n> I think condenser is on by default already, isn't it?\r\n\r\nNot for the cloud version hosted by All Hands, there's a different settings chain and we kept it off until the context-forgetting issue was resolved.\r\n\r\n> > The only bit of info being added here that isn't crucial is the `considered_event_ids` field (and maybe the `condenser_cls` field, but that'll be used when I update the agent controller's context truncation).\r\n> \r\n> There is also `forgotten_ids`, or am I missing something? As far as I can tell, and please correct me if wrong, for all except LLM_ATTENTION, this field holds a list that we can, alternatively, compute from much less information (start, end; a slice of history).\r\n\r\nOkay, so there's two issues here:\r\n\r\nFirst, some fields (`considered_event_ids`) are not necessary for describing _how_ the condensation event modifies the history. But it's useful and human-parseable, and I agree with Graham it's worth keeping around.\r\n\r\nSecond, some fields (`considered_event_ids` and `forgotten_event_ids`) are not as compact as they could be. It sounds like this is a big concern for you @enyst, considering your proposal in #7526, so maybe I can address some of that here.\r\n\r\n> I'd love your thoughts on https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/7526 , as minimal (-ish) alternative. Could it have, or maybe it doesn't have all we actually need?\r\n\r\nI actually tried a similar approach when working on this PR, but I found myself re-inventing the `pydantic` wheel to get out of the serialization slog. My concerns aren't representational, they're to do with code complexity and control-flow: without `pydantic` capabilities to do per-strategy field validation, history reconstruction gets pretty brittle and difficult to recover from.\r\n\r\nOne big benefit of a uniform condensation event is that history reconstruction is _uniform_. There's no delegation to condensers or a big switch statement over the condenser strategy (technically we have the former now but the implementations are _nearly_ the same and can be made the same without issue), both of which are sources of complexity hindering your suggested refactor re: condensers and conversation manager straightforward.\r\n\r\nThe single event approach won't be as space-efficient as some kind of union, but it really helps to keep code complexity down.\r\n\r\n> I'm not fully sure though, with event streams of 3k+ events, that's a lot of info to send via the websocket, even, every step, and of course to save and to parse? 🤔\r\n\r\nI don't know how the numbers shake out here tbh, but I expect the space-inefficient condensation events are a minor contributor to event stream bloat. With the default condenser, a condensation happens once every ~20 steps and forgets ~20 events. That means the inefficient condensation event (with a list of IDs instead of a start/end ID) stores an extra 18 integers. \r\n\r\nRight now I think it makes sense to err on the side of simpler code and worry about the optimizations later, especially if we're still hoping to refactor the conversation manager into the mix. If that's a deal-breaker for you I'd be happy to address the concerns in a follow-up PR (i.e., #7526).\nJust a quick note here\r\n> First, some fields (considered_event_ids) are not necessary for describing how the condensation event modifies the history. But it's useful and human-parseable, and I agree with Graham it's worth keeping around.\r\n\r\nSure, that makes sense, just to clarify though, we have two alternatives for this one:\r\n- event stream\r\n- state.\r\n\r\nCould we save it in state? We keep things needed for evals there, and evals read it from last state.\r\n\nWhat I would love to see, is that we get the right architecture for the stream - so for the event(s).\r\n\r\nWe can do the rest in follow up PRs.\r\n\r\n> Right now I think it makes sense to err on the side of simpler code and worry about the optimizations later, especially if we're still hoping to refactor the conversation manager into the mix. If that's a deal-breaker for you I'd be happy to address the concerns in a follow-up PR (i.e., #7526).\r\n\r\nThe problem with doing this in the stream, is that the stream is saved on users' machines, and so if we modify it later, we need to make extra compatibility code to keep it working. In time _that_ becomes full of stuff, error prone, and it hinders us from migrating to pydantic. There are exceptions but they are extremely rare and special circumstance.\r\n\r\nSo the event, as we discussed [before](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/7353#issuecomment-2738563320), the event is what we could at least try to figure it out - maybe fail if it's too complicated, but is it?\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I don't know that it's simpler to dump everything in the stream, it does seem simpler maybe if we look only at all condensers, but idk, maybe it's only me, it seems more complex from the perspective of the other things in the system. Because for example conversation memory needs to care anyway about what the condenser results in (e.g. we need to do the verification step to eliminate unpaired events).\r\n\nSorry for the quick notes, I just want to point out I don't fully understand this, and maybe it's the source of the different impact we feel it has:\r\n\r\n> With the default condenser, a condensation happens once every ~20 steps and forgets ~20 events. That means the inefficient condensation event (with a list of IDs instead of a start/end ID) stores an extra 18 integers.\r\n\r\nYes, the first time it happens. In a 2,000 event stream, though, that means plenty of AgentCondensationActions, each storing lists. It seems like the best we could hope for if we store lists, is that we only store an id at most once, which means AgentCondensationActions together store ~1,980, at the minimum, plus some overlap (not sure), plus the `considered` list.\n> Could we save it in state? We keep things needed for evals there, and evals read it from last state.\r\n\r\nI'd classify it more as \"debug\" information than eval information. I can move it to the `State` but I also don't know how to tell a user with a messed up session how they should send me the associated `State` object like I do with the trajectory.\r\n\r\n> Yes, the first time it happens.

Maybe I'm missing some context on the average size of events? Benchmarks aren't always indicative, but a SWE-bench run I was looking at yesterday had an average of ~12k characters per event. If we conservatively assume 10 characters per integer that's only an extra 3.3 events worth of data.\r\n\r\n> The problem with doing this in the stream, is that the stream is saved on users' machines, and so if we modify it later, we need to make extra compatibility code to keep it working.

I can move it to the `State` but I also don't know how to tell a user with a messed up session how they should send me the associated `State` object like I do with the trajectory.\r\n\r\nI see, I think maybe we can make sure that the flow between agent, with full `state.history`, and the creation of a condensation action is both well tested, and have logs. The trajectory will never contain everything in logs, after all. I can see that more information than the trajectory may be needed, preferably debug logs.\r\n\r\nAlso, if we have the event stream, maybe we're able to [replay](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/6049) it.\n@enyst I think I've addressed your concerns about the condensation event, please take a look and let me know. It sounds like that's the only thing that can't be resolved in future PRs and I'd really like to tackle some issues downstream of these changes.\r\n\r\nEDIT TO ADD: I'm really trying to avoid flat representations of polymorphic events like we see in #7526. Very easy to do with `pydantic` but with the current system I keep running into all kinds of corner cases. This approach has a single event (with an unavoidable instance of field polymorphism) that can be used by all existing condensers. There's a big assumption about event IDs in the range calculations though -- can you confirm that's an okay assumption to make?\n> EDIT TO ADD: I'm really trying to avoid flat representations of polymorphic events like we see in #7526.

It is definitely the case in the stream, and it is the case in history save for the truncation in action. I can look into stopping that, but if this PR works as expected, that case should be extremely rare with Claude and other LLMs with decent-ish windows.\nI restored a ~450 events session made from the `main` branch.

I definitely want to improve the back-and-forth between the two, and I think `CondensationAction` events are the current shortest path to doing so.\n@neubig Sure, but sorry, just to clarify, I agree with Calvin that ContextWindowExceeded not handled on a previous session is _expected_. We don't have exception handling in condensers, so if ContextWindowExceededError happens during their LLM call, falls to the controller.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, those should extremely rare, at least with LLMs with some decent context window size.\r\n\r\nExcept for previous sessions, that is, sessions made on `main` etc, if they already are at the limit or more, those will fail like before, but I think that's okay. The newer sessions should recognize the new Actions in history. IMHO we don't need to solve it here (it's longstanding and known, and IMHO not trivial).\r\n\r\n[5c3288e4f277426388257d13a3a6ab9a.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19489672/5c3288e4f277426388257d13a3a6ab9a.zip)\r\nIf you wish to take a look at this fun stream, it's here. I _think_ it can be loaded with the UI by simply placing the directory in the local filestore. If that doesn't work (haven't tried lately), then running with main.py and stopping in the debugger to switch [sid](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/24773e15c53b0f9b34e3883248f56c2ade9b88a1/openhands/core/main.py#L94) to this sid would work. Deleting all events from 451 (inclusive), and load the rest, loads a nice history just under 200k, so the next user message would bump it over the Anthropic limit.\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR feedback covers various aspects of implementation and architectural decisions regarding the condensation mechanism in the event stream. Key concerns include ensuring that the event stream only stores necessary data, as excessive information could complicate user compatibility and hinder future migrations. One proposal suggests shifting some logic to the `conversation_memory` component for better code clarity. \n\nThe `considered_event_ids` field is debated; while initially seen as redundant, it may serve a valuable role in tracing user history and could aid UI integration. There's caution against flat representations of polymorphic events, favoring a uniform approach that minimizes code complexity at the potential cost of storage inefficiency. It’s highlighted that historical events, particularly those exceeding context limits, should gracefully transition to the new system without breaking existing sessions. Robust exception handling is also emphasized, specifically for managing LLM calls to avoid cascading failures."

    "unsumarized_comments": "> @neubig Hi Prof., till now I tested on a few (13) swe-bench instances that are mutual between `swe-bench-lite` and `swe-bench-verified`, using max same 30 turns:\r\n> \r\n> * CoAct can resolve 8/13\r\n> * CodeAct v1.8 can resolve 9/13\r\n>   which is IMO not really bad for an initial draft (without robust replanning tested and some prompt improvements to make it more reliable). I'm gonna try to run some more instances in the next few days to be more certain about its ability, but it might be a bit slow due to the heavy nature of the eval harness right now, and some other issues I ran into during evaluation: timeout issues with the runtime, a few multiprocessing issues when using more than 1 workers. I'm not sure how many instances should we run to get a reliable score for the implementation and accept the first draft (maybe into a separate branch). Can I get your thought on this? Also Cc @xingyaoww if you have some ideas to share.\r\n\r\nI think it is also important to track the cost for both as that would be an important factor to estimate whether CoAct is overkill at times and maybe that gets stuck in more local executor loops which may be avoided with a guidance in the loop.\nHey @ryanhoangt , sounds good!\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure how many instances should we run to get a reliable score for the implementation and accept the first draft (maybe into a separate branch).\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure what \"accept into a separate branch\" means? This already is a separate branch, right?\r\n\r\nBut in terms of a target, maybe we could run the smaller set of 92 that you created. I think the eval harness is probably in better shape now, so maybe it won't be too bad?\n@ketan1741 @tobitege I uploaded the trajectory to my viz [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ryanhoangt/evaluation?filepaths=outputs%2Fswe_bench_lite%2FCoActPlannerAgent%2Fclaude-3-5-sonnet%4020240620_maxiter_40_N_v1.0-no-hint%2Foutput.jsonl), as uploading a subset of eval on OpenHands's official space may confuse people. Maybe we can have a look to see if there are any obvious improvements to make.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is because currently the eval process doesn't capture the trajectory for delegation, we can't see how the executor performed on the visualization. We can address this before running a new eval.\n@enyst thanks for the quick fix and the insightful comments.\r\n\r\nRe the `django__django-10914` instance, it's interesting to know there're some unclear specs here, I don't know which behavior I should advocate 😅. But I think there're not much we can do, it's more to do with the LLM than the agent implementation.\r\n\r\n> we are making CodeAct a delegate and it's not yet ready for it.\r\n\r\nYeah I can also imagine some other weird cases that might come up, and we will need more work to make the agent (with delegation) robustly usable on the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\nTbh this is also not a version that I expected initially (i.e., using the grouding test case to help the agent resolve the issue) and am happy with, but it seems to be a good start in this direction. I'll try to look into other instances' trajectory and explore some other variations to see if it helps. Should I close this PR for now?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHi @jatinganhotra, regarding the full evaluation, I think it will likely further lower the score, as the remaining instances are not included in `swe-bench-verified`. IMO It would be more beneficial to run the full eval after validating the agent gets good scores on this \"verified\" subset.\r\n\r\nOn All Hands's Slack we have a dedicated channel named \"workflows\" to discuss about this topic. We'd love to chat more about improvement ideas there.\n > Tbh this is also not a version that I expected initially and am happy with, but it seems to be a good start in this direction. I'll try to look into other instances' trajectory and explore some other variations to see if it helps.\r\n\r\nI also hope that understanding and debugging swe-bench issues will get easier after [PR 3808](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3808) (simpler execution flow in the backend, fix delegates) and [PR 3413](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pull/3413) (logging prompts).\r\n\r\n> Should I close this PR for now?\r\n\r\nSorry, that's not what I meant. Up to you, of course, but IMHO it's worth looking into it a bit more, fixing stuff around what happens. It is quite amazing that it solves 6 more than `main`, but for some reason we still don't know it breaks in 9. FWIW the 2 tests I worked with were from those 9 that pass on `main` but failed on branch, and they passed every time.\r\n\r\nTwo minor thoughts:\r\n\r\n- the PR sends the new actions as serialized in json, but CodeAct doesn't do that usually, it sends strings as in a dialogue with the llm. It may be less confusing to the LLM if we are consistent and add the new ones [around here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/f996b31d64634b526bef1d68983f5752e2ca5867/agenthub/codeact_agent/codeact_agent.py#L159) in a similar format, extracting the useful info. Small note, Claude doesn't do as well with JSON as GPT-4o in my experience, not because it can't but it seems to need some prompting or gets confused at times.\r\n- what do you think, what if we give Claude the prompt pieces, and ask it to rephrase for clarity, precision, and all info needed?\r\n\r\nOne other thing that may help merging this PR is if we can keep to a minimum the changes to the default agent or show that it doesn't affect its performance. Just my thought, not sure how others think about it?\nSounds good, I can do the debugging in the next few days and try running a new eval to obtain the trajectory of the executor. In previous eval, bugs such as missing the </execute...> tag in the stop sequences also negatively affected the performance, as it made the planner to execute the plan itself. Also happy to hear other ideas on improving this!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso just to clarify a bit, the 6/9 diff above are for instances at medium (15m-1h) level. There's also a diagram for instances at easy (<15m) level (the 2 instances you ran is in the red subset)\r\n![Venn Diagram of Resolved Easy Instance IDs](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d298ae8-c831-4826-8cef-76c907981e07)\r\n\r\nI looked into the trajectory in this easy level, one observation that make CoAct failed on many instances is that the planner very often came up with plans that have more steps than needed (often the plan contained 3 phases but only 1 of them was actually required to resolve the issue).\r\n\r\n---\r\nSome questions:\r\n\r\n> the PR sends the new actions as serialized in json\r\n\r\nCan you clarify this? I'm not sure I did any json serialization in the PR...\r\n\r\n> One other thing that may help merging this PR is if we can keep to a minimum the changes to the default agent\r\n\r\nI think there're no changes to CodeAct execution in this PR, except the `message` property of `AgentDelegateAction` (which CodeAct should not use in swe-bench). Can you point out some changes that you're concerned?\r\n\r\n> what do you think, what if we give Claude the prompt pieces, and ask it to rephrase for clarity, precision, and all info needed?\r\n\r\nCan you give an example of this?\r\n\r\n\n> Can you clarify this? I'm not sure I did any json serialization in the PR...\r\n\r\n🤔 I guess it could be that it's the default serialization, so if they're not added at that point in CodeAct, maybe it takes it by default? Not fully sure, but anyway I think it's visible when you look at the trajectories linked above, I'm looking now at the first of those 2, and step 9 is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAction\r\n{\r\n\"id\":20\r\n\"timestamp\":\"2024-09-16T19:46:29.172006\"\r\n\"source\":\"agent\"\r\n\"message\":\"The new test method has been added successfully.

Might be because this action is not handled properly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nreturn AgentFinishAction(thought=thought, outputs={'content': thought})\r\n``` \r\n\r\n> There's something else that looks suspicious to me just after this. The next prompt sent to the LLM is from the Executor, and its prompt includes some text from the Planner-specific prompt\r\n\r\nYeah I also noticed this issue. My intention is to make the Planner include the full user message (hence the full problem statement in swe-bench) to give executor some more context, but sometimes it included the message from the few-shot examples, or the \"Now, let's come up with 2 global plans sequentially.\" as you saw, which is problematic.\r\n\r\n> I thought this section about \"let's come up with 2 global plans sequentially\" is part of the Planner agent prompt, and \"playing the role of a subordinate employee\" is the Executor. (Then the phases are written by the Planner for the Executor.) Isn't that the case? Does the above look expected?\r\n\r\n\"let's come up with 2 global plans sequentially\" - this is an extra piece of prompt used only in swe-bench evaluation for CoActPlanner. Similar to `CodeActSWEAgent` below, it can be used to steer the agent a bit to be better at a specific task, but I'm not sure the current \"2 global plans\" is the optimal way to go. In `CodeActAgent` there're many cases where the agent just fixed the issues without creating any tests.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/41ddba84bd0d62f8a4bc48d08addde4b4269a687/evaluation/swe_bench/run_infer.py#L248-L290\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "In the ongoing evaluation of CoAct and CodeAct v1.8 against the `swe-bench` instances, several technical issues were raised. CoAct resolved 8/13 instances, and CodeAct v1.8 resolved 9/13, indicating a promising initial performance despite not implementing robust replanning or prompt enhancements. Concerns include timeout issues, runtime inefficiencies, and problems with the evaluation harness. A query was raised about the number of instances required for a reliable score, suggesting that 92 instances could be a target after improvements. Additionally, there are concerns regarding JSON serialization inconsistencies, which may confuse LLMs like Claude—recommendations include maintaining format consistency and refining prompts for clarity. Debugging trajectories revealed that CoAct often produced overly complex plans, which hindered performance; addressing this in further evaluations is necessary. Finally, visibility into trajectory delegation performance needs improvement before the next evaluation round."

Yes, it is a different approach compared to using micro-agents. \r\n\r\nI believe the main benefit of this approach is that the agents will decide when to use the MCP tools instead of explicitly stating how and when to trigger them via microagent knowledge.\r\nWe also don't need to have a mapping between microagents and MCP Servers.\r\n\r\nWe can also do like @xingyaoww said, by adding specific MCP servers for the microagent to use, which is a win-win imo\nQuick thought/suggestion (although I don't know how difficult implementation of all this is):\r\n\r\nA lot of the most popular MCP servers are Stdio and I think a lot of folks won't use open hands if they have to jump through another hoop to get them working in that way. Is there a way to integrate this tool below? I've been using it, and it's a brilliant way to organize MCP servers. MetaMCP itself is an MCP, so I think you would just need to handle the case where that is Stdio. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/metatool-ai/metatool-app\nHey @AtAFork, i do plan to add smth like mcp-hub (https://github.com/ravitemer/mcp-hub) that will handle both stdio and sse that live inside the runtime container -- this allow us to support both stdio and sse while the backend only assume support for SSE.\r\nThis will probably happen in future PR -- stay tuned!\r\n\r\n\nAnd thanks for recommending metamcp! https://github.com/metatool-ai/mcp-server-metamcp?tab=readme-ov-file#using-as-an-sse-server did a quick look here, and it seems they also support some sort of \"SSE server\" - but that's dependent on the MetaMCP \"app\" which is probably overkill for the OpenHands usecase for now.\r\n\r\nBut with MCP+SSE implemented in this PR, user can just start their own metamcp server with SSE, and then directly plugin that SSE link -- so there's actually no need to support stdio for metaMCP",

    "sumarized_length": 1073,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR comments highlighted several technical issues and concerns that warrant attention. Firstly, there are implementation suggestions for overriding `SandboxConfig` in `local_runtime.py`, specifically bypassing `config.run_as_openhands` and `sandbox.user_id`, opting instead for the current user’s ID and name. Additionally, `self.config.workspace_mount_path_in_sandbox` should point to a locally accessible directory.\n\nA critical question remains regarding the necessity for the \"local\" runtime to execute as root, which could pose security risks; the recommendation is to shift to using the current user after thorough testing to ensure dependency management, like `tmux`, is appropriately handled.\n\nMoreover, issues were raised about the environment setup for CI, noting that setting `WORKSPACE_BASE` does not seem to influence the configured tool paths correctly. This inconsistency can lead to file creation in unexpected locations, undermining intended functionality. Establishing robust documentation and further testing of these features are essential next steps."

A specific failing test, related to an LLM API key, should be addressed as it presently fails locally and on the main branch: `tests/unit/test_config.py::test_invalid_toml_format`. It is also highlighted that server failures indicate potential issues with the Jupyter server, leading to errors such as `open_file not defined`, which suggests a missing dependency in `swe_env_box.py`. \n\nConcerns include potential mismatches in Python environments, where the Jupyter kernel runs a different Python interpreter than expected.

Notably, path traversal security checks were implemented through `os.path.realpath()` and workspace path validation, ensuring robust error handling for invalid paths.

I agree that maintaining a coherent directory structure will be very valuable.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd prefer to not isolate the `aider` files by their library of origin (`aider`) but rather by their functionality (e.g. for `linter` probably something like `program_analysis`), because that would allow us to further branch out to other varieties of tools in the same general genre as necessary.\n@ryanhoangt  Ughh, maybe it is not a good idea for me to directly push to your branch (maybe make things more messy) - feel free to revert if you want!\r\n\r\nSo I:\r\n- make `ENABLE_REPOMAP` a configurable thing in the config\r\n- and add `repomap_workspace`, which will default to `workspace_base` as you described earlier\r\n- did some tweak in the SWE-Bench `run_infer.py` to set `repomap_workspace` to the corresponding github repo directory (e.g., `/workspace/XXX`) instead of `/workspace`.\r\n\r\nYou can run it by set your `config.toml`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[core]\r\ncache_dir = \"/tmp/swe_bench_eval_cache_root\"\r\nworkspace_base = \"/home/xingyaow/OpenDevin-dev/workspace\"\r\nworkspace_mount_path = \"/home/xingyaow/OpenDevin-dev/workspace\"\r\nsandbox_container_image = \"ghcr.io/opendevin/sandbox:main\"\r\nsandbox_type = \"ssh\"\r\nssh_hostname = \"localhost\"\r\nsandbox_timeout = 120\r\nmax_chars = 100_000_000\r\n\r\n# SWEBench eval specific\r\nuse_host_network = false\r\nrun_as_devin = false\r\nenable_auto_lint = true\r\npersist_sandbox = false\r\nenable_repomap = true\r\n\r\n[eval_gpt4o_2024_05_13]\r\ntemperature = 0.0\r\nmodel = \"gpt-4o-2024-05-13\"\r\napi_key = \"sk-proj-YOURKEY\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAND RUN `evaluation/swe_bench/scripts/run_infer.sh eval_gpt4o_2024_05_13 HEAD CodeActAgent 1` to reproduce.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some issues with file permissions.\r\n- By default, SWE-Bench does not mount the host workspace into the docker container since it already has everything (e.g., testbed, environment) built into it. However, the current implementation of `RepoMap` requires the **backend** to access the workspace directory. This makes supporting the current SWE-Bench eval very challenging.\r\n- To overcome this, I added a workaround (https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/pull/2248/commits/7e718d77855841056d0ffc741336c785b87f0dba) to support mounting the host directory into containers - But since inside the container, the agent is working on SWE-Bench problem as \"root,\" so it will create the `/workspace/reponame_repoversion` folder with the root user.\r\n- And on the host machine, the `RepoMap` code will try to create files under `/workspace/reponame_repoversion` - which will cause permission issue: You cannot create something under a directory owned by root.\r\n\r\nI'm still thinking about a workaround, but I guess long-term it will be nice if we can put this RepoMap utility into `od-runtime-cli` proposed in https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/issues/2404 so that the RepoMap can be constructed within the runtime and passed back to the backend -- This will save us from wrestling with file permissions. cc @yufansong .\r\n\r\n\nI made more progress here by hacking with file ownership/group: https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/pull/2490\r\n\r\nBut I think this is not the cleanest way (and not the way we want!) to do this, AND when the agent edited the file / create a new file, the permission messed up again and RepoMap failed to construct again..\r\n\r\n@ryanhoangt Do you think if is easier if we pack our current `RepoMap` into an `agentskills` to be run inside sandbox, so that we can avoid most of these issues?\r\n\r\nAfter integrated into `agentskills`, when architecture refractor is finished, it will be really easy to connect the backend to this RepoMap AND avoid all the hacky thing we need to do for the RepoMap workspace mounting.\n> @ryanhoangt Do you think if is easier if we pack our current `RepoMap` into an `agentskills` to be run inside sandbox, so that we can avoid most of these issues?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help! I'm also planning to do this, can give it a try over the weekend, when I have some capacity. But after putting it into `agentskills`, we'll need to adjust the prompt to make the agent call the function when needed right?\r\n\r\n> But I think this is not the cleanest way (and not the way we want!) to do this, AND when the agent edited the file / create a new file, the permission messed up again and RepoMap failed to construct again..\r\n\r\nSo with your current integration, can we run some instances to quickly evaluate the effectiveness of injecting `RepoMap` in every step? (which is different when we move it to `agentskills` I think)\n>  we'll need to adjust the prompt to make the agent call the function when needed right?\r\n\r\nYes - or we can simulate the execution by calling that `agentskills` *for* the agent in a certain way (e.g., issuing an `IPythonRunCellAction` for every turn and get a repo map to put into user message) - it will be much clearer how we can do this once we finish the arch refractor https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/issues/2404\r\n\r\n> So with your current integration, can we run some instances to quickly evaluate the effectiveness of injecting RepoMap in every step? (which is different when we move it to agentskills I think)\r\n\r\nNot really.. So the issue is that the agent is running as `root` inside the container, and the current RepoMap implementation operates on the mounted workspace (`/workspace`) where the agent creates/edits files as `root.`\r\nIn https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/pull/2490, I added some hacks to make all the files in `/workspace` be owned by a group that contains both `root` and the host user -- so that the host user can also read and create files there.\r\nHowever, Once an agent touches a file, it may change the ownership of that file back to `root` again, causing the backend on the host to have permission errors in reading that file. So, the repo map may not be correctly generated AFTER the first step.\r\n\nNot sure what the plan is, but this PR would also need integration tests like all other parts of agentskills.\r\nWhich can be quite some work due to how those are set up, run and potentially regenerated.",
    "sumarized_length": 1467,
    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment raises several concrete technical issues related to the implementation of the RepoMap feature:\n\n1. **Workspace Handling**: The current design assumes that the workspace is a Git repository and builds the repomap from tracked files only. There is ambiguity about how to handle non-Git workspaces (e.g., including cache directories and `node_modules`). A suggestion is to limit RepoMap functionality to GitHub repositories for clarity.\n\n2. **Performance Concerns**: Construction of the repomap is noted to degrade user experience in large codebases (e.g., OpenDevin). Configurability for repomap construction is proposed, alongside logging an issue for performance optimization.\n\n3. **File Permissions Issues**: The implementation faces permissions challenges due to the agent running as root in Docker, which complicates workspace access. A workaround is currently in place, but it’s not sustainable. It is suggested to incorporate the RepoMap utility into `od-runtime-cli` to mitigate permission issues in the long term.\n\n4. **Integration Testing**: There's a need for integration tests for the RepoMap as part of the agentskills, which could require significant preparation work. \n\nOverall, structural organization revisions were discussed for the `aider` files based on functionality rather than origin, aiming for coherence in directory structure. Further adjustments to prompt configurations for agent interactions with RepoMap are also indicated."

The implementation meets the original objective of making the code more robust and maintainable, while potentially being even more straightforward than the initially suggested approach.\n\nNO REMAINING ISSUES IDENTIFIED\nJust wanted to +1 this as it’s an issue I’ve run into. Been doing a lot of experiments with only “think” and “finish” tools, which causes this failure mode. \n@xingyaoww one more question I'm running into: was the official eval run with llm editor enabled or disabled?\r\n\r\nIt looks like we hardcode disabled in `run_infer.py`, but I seem to recall we did run with it enabled for non-native tool use at some point 🤔 ",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR raises multiple technical concerns regarding the handling of disabled tools within the function call converter's in-context learning example. The original implementation relied on fixed examples that assumed tool availability, risking misleading outputs when tools were disabled. It was highlighted that the converter was not adequately updated after introducing user-configurable tool settings.\n\nA robust solution was suggested, which includes creating a dynamic example generation system that adapts based on available tools. The proposed solution involves introducing a `TOOL_EXAMPLES` dictionary, implementing the `get_example_for_tools` function to detect and construct examples based on enabled tools, and ensuring proper string handling.\n\nActionable feedback includes fixing failing unit tests in `test_llm_fncall_converter.py` to ensure coverage of the newly implemented features. Additionally, ensure that all lines from previous examples, particularly before key statements, are retained after refactoring for clarity and completeness. A thorough analysis of this approach is requested before final implementation."

    "sumarized_length": 1219,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR highlights several critical issues regarding dependency management and installation failures. Firstly, there's a persistent error in installing the package `pymupdfb (1.24.1)` indicating that installation candidates could not be found, likely due to platform compatibility with Ubuntu ARM. This suggests a need for specifying compatible versions or architectures within the `pyproject.toml` to prevent similar issues for different platforms.\n\nAdditionally, there are authorization errors when accessing PyTorch packages, pointing to potential configuration issues or access rights that need resolution. The mention of using Python 3.10 instead of 3.11 raises concerns about version compatibility with certain dependencies, particularly `llama-index`. \n\nTo mitigate these issues, it's recommended to routinely update the `Makefile` and the `pyproject.toml` on each commit for consistency and to explore isolating platform-specific dependencies to improve installation reliability across environments. The unresolved dependency with `torch` further emphasizes the need for testing package installations on different environments, specifically on macOS systems where distinct compatibility concerns are encountered."

I have a WIP to implement the behavior suggested by @xingyaoww and apply it for CodeAct. I think it's best to close this one, and open a new PR, from a branch that was restarted almost clean with a patch applied to main. (I'll also move it to a branch in the main repo)\r\n\r\nThis was initially made with monologue in mind, but I don't know, applying the older version won't really work as such because monologue is also cut off from condenser atm, since we've updated it to not store its own event history here https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin/pull/1863. We can re-attach it when done, and summarized events/messages are restored in the event stream. (I think?)\r\n\r\nThis got so interesting when I attempted to apply these insights into how it could work. I feel it changes deeply both the process and even whether the summary is an Action or an Observation 😅. The best part is, CodeAct itself is working on it!",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment raises several critical technical points concerning the implementation of the memory condensing functionality. The reviewer suggests first reverting all existing test artifact changes before regenerating, noting that the current script is designed to bypass real LLM calls if tests pass. There is also a concern about environmental variables, specifically that `WORKSPACE_MOUNT_PATH_IN_SANDBOX` was not masked, which the author acknowledged and has fixed. The PR explores a dual approach of condensing event sets multiple times and prioritizing recent events, though concerns remain about the robustness of these strategies against the `ContextWindowExceeded` error. The reviewer emphasizes the need for further measures against potential summary failures, suggesting iterative improvements. It is also noted that existing code already trims output to limit token count, but some unique handling for exceptionally large observations is still required. Finally, there is an intention to close the current PR and initiate a new one focused on applying these insights for CodeAct."

Understand the other half of the desired behavior:\r\n- if the last OH terminal is idle (nothing is running it in), then we want to reuse it! not create a new one\r\n- only if it's not idle, we want to leave it alone to run its program, AND make a new terminal for our --task\nOVERVIEW:\n\n✅ Successfully Resolved:\n- Core issue of interrupting running programs\n- Terminal reuse logic for idle terminals\n- Creation of new terminals when needed\n- Edge case handling\n- Program preservation in existing terminals\n\nThe changes appear to fully address all reported issues through proper terminal status detection and handling logic. The solution implements both required behaviors (reusing idle terminals and preserving busy ones) while maintaining efficiency.\n\n🔍 Verdict: All issues appear to be successfully resolved with no remaining concerns identified in the provided information.\nHi! OpenHands has been working on addressing the Node.js version compatibility issues and the critical build logic flaw you identified.\n\n## ✅ Issues Fixed\n\n### 1. Critical Build Logic Flaw\nYou were absolutely right about the build script incorrectly skipping builds when `.vsix` exists. This was preventing proper development rebuilds. **This has been fixed** - the script now always builds when Node.js is adequate, regardless of existing `.vsix` files.\n\n### 2. Node.js Version Alignment\nWe've aligned the VSCode extension Node.js requirement with the frontend:\n- **Updated to Node.js ≥18** (matching frontend's actual usage via Volta: 18.20.1)\n- Added proper engine requirement in `package.json`\n- Updated all documentation and error messages\n\n### 3. Graceful Fallback for Older Node.js\nThe build system now:\n- ✅ **Builds from source** when Node.js ≥18 is available\n- ✅ **Falls back to pre-built .vsix** for older Node.js versions\n- ✅ **Respects SKIP_VSCODE_BUILD=1** environment variable\n- ✅ **Always rebuilds during development** (fixed the critical flaw)\n\n## 📋 Current Status\n\n- ✅ Branch merged with latest main\n- ✅ All Python linting passes\n- ✅ Build script tested and working correctly\n- ✅ Node.js version requirements aligned across project\n- ✅ All changes committed and pushed\n\n## 🔧 Technical Details\n\nThe build logic now follows this correct flow:\n1. **Skip entirely** if `SKIP_VSCODE_BUILD=1`\n2. **Build from source** if Node.js ≥18 available\n3. **Use pre-built fallback** if Node.js <18 and `.vsix` exists\n4. **Warn and skip** if Node.js <18 and no pre-built `.vsix`\n\nThis ensures developers can always rebuild during development while maintaining compatibility for users with older Node.js versions.\n\nThanks for catching that critical logic error - it was indeed preventing proper development workflows!\n\n—OpenHands-Claude\n@xingyaoww Great point about the `make build` limitation! 🎯\n\n**Good news**: We've already implemented the first part of your suggestion! 🚀\n\n## ✅ **What's Now Available:**\n- **New CI Workflow**: `.github/workflows/vscode-extension-build.yml`\n- **Automatic Building**: Runs on PRs that touch VSCode extension files\n- **Multi-Node Testing**: Tests with Node.js 18, 20, 22\n- **PR Artifacts**: Auto-uploads .vsix files with 7-day retention\n- **Download Links**: Posts PR comments with installation instructions\n\n## 🎯 **Current Status:**\nThe CI workflow is **live and working** - it already built and commented on this PR! You can now:\n1. **Test extensions** directly from PR artifacts\n2. **Validate builds** across Node.js versions\n3. **Download .vsix** files without running `make build`\n\n## 🔮 **Future Options** (as you mentioned, not needed in this PR):\n1. **GitHub Releases**: Attach .vsix to releases\n2. **Package Registry**: Publish to GitHub/NPM packages\n3. **Marketplace**: Eventual VS Code Marketplace publishing\n\nThe current implementation complements the existing PyPI distribution (which includes the .vsix) while providing immediate PR-level validation and testing.\n\nThanks for the great suggestion - it's already making the development workflow smoother! 🙌\n\n---\n*OpenHands-Claude*\n@xingyaoww I think the behavior now is:\r\n- for select text, it does apply a prompt around it\r\n- for file, sends file name + your PR\r\n- auto install attempts:\r\n    1. first, it tries to download from a GitHub URL, from releases of the extension, tagged ext-v.0.0.1 etc\r\n    2. if it fails, it tries to install from the bundled `openhands-ai` package (should keep this option?)\r\n    3. if it fails, it tries the vscode marketplace (this will fail for now, it's just for the future; could clean that out?)\r\n- CI has 2 steps:\r\n  1. build and validate the .vsix is an archive\r\n  2. GitHub release step (on a tag `ext-v*`)\r\n \r\n_Edited to add:_ Node 22\r\n\r\n@mamoodi I think so, but I don't think we should hurry. Quite a bit of this is hard to test since we have no released version for example, yet.

    "summarized_comments": "This PR efficiently resolves multiple issues in the VSCode integration for the OpenHands project. Key points include:\n\n1. **Terminal Behavior Fix**: The previously buggy terminal handling logic was corrected to ensure that an idle terminal is reused while preventing interruptions of running programs. This was achieved by modifying the terminal management in `extension.ts`, emphasizing the need to check terminal status and creating new terminals only when necessary.\n\n2. **Build Logic Correction**: Addressed a critical flaw in the build process that skipped builds if a `.vsix` file existed. This was rectified to ensure builds occur based on Node.js version requirements without being obstructed by existing binary files.\n\n3. **Node.js Version Alignment**: Streamlined the compatibility requirement for Node.js to ≥18, aligning it with the frontend and improving documentation related to installation processes.\n\n4. **CI Workflow Implementation**: A new CI process was established for automatic building, validating, and downloading artifacts from pull requests, enhancing testing across multiple Node.js versions.\n\nOverall, the changes have been successful in addressing core issues while adhering to best practices in terminal management and build processes."

Let me know.\r\n\r\n@vinodvarma24, it is fully functional on my fork right now. to use the containers, you will need to run interpreter with ```-uc #or --use_container```. also when you run it and input your openai key for some reason it doesn't pass that to litellm. someone will fix that I'm sure, or its a problem with my fork and Ill figure it out. in any case just export the key to ```OPENAI_API_KEY=key```\r\n\r\nI also implemented 2 cli functions. ```%upload``` and ```%download```. both take either one or more file paths to a file to upload or download from the container. also when using the download command you need to have it like ```%download /mnt/data/file-to-download.txt```, since /mn/data is the default workdir i put the AI in so it tries not to go exploring and mess things up.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know any critique you have or what could be improved!\nDefinitely a cool idea, but I had some issues running it locally after checking out your branch:\r\n\r\n![OpenInterpreter-Container-Mode](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/assets/1667415/6c72c725-7733-442b-bb43-c467a061d00f)\r\n\r\n![OpenInterpreter-Container-Mode-2](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/assets/1667415/32f3ac62-5b0f-4454-b81c-3f0e6d995f3d)\n> Definitely a cool idea, but I had some issues running it locally after checking out your branch:\r\n> \r\n> ![OpenInterpreter-Container-Mode](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1667415/272067237-6c72c725-7733-442b-bb43-c467a061d00f.gif) \r\n> ![OpenInterpreter-Container-Mode-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1667415/272067262-32f3ac62-5b0f-4454-b81c-3f0e6d995f3d.gif) \r\n\r\nAlso @ericrallen referencing a file in your local system wont work, since the file isn't in the container. to upload it to the container use ```%upload [file-path]```\r\n\nIncredible work Nathan @unaidedelf8777!

This is a fair number of files + complexity to introduce to the codebase, so I want to be sure we implement this as minimally as possible.\r\n\r\nYes, So currently the container image uncompressed sits at about 1.81 gb, with the main contributor to the size just being the basic dependencies which I added for each language ( We can change this as needed of course if making it lightweight is a priority ). While Running OI inside of a singular container is feasible and may be a good option for some, It also takes away the ability to add dependencies into the container, since the container would be starting anew each time you use it. and that's the other thing; your starting anew each time + users will need to re-import files each time they want to use a file from there host system, and also exporting files from a singular container to the users host sys would be a nightmare, since docker isn't too keen on letting containers effect the host system. \r\n\r\nthat's why I opted for a more session based approach since it means that a users container can persist as long as needed, whether it be local or remote on a host server.  \r\n\r\nanyway that's my two sense.\nI'm constantly facing this error, even though the Docker desktop is running on my Mac and I'm able to run different containers in it.

(sorry, I tried this, couldn't figure it, any clue would be helpful :) ) \n@vinodvarma24 , This is weird. Are you sure you uninstalled the pip wheel from the last broken version? also, those 2 containers should be the exact same thing ( same file aswell ). basically when downloading the image the code re-tags the docker image so that it can find it quicker at runtime. regarding the dir issue, I'm not sure to be completely honest; One thing you could try is going into the code, at ```interpreter/code_interpreters/container_utils/container_utils.py```, and then just removing the bind option from the docker engine API call, that way it isn't trying to mount in the session directory, nor will it make it ( I think ). it should look somewhat like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n    def init_container(self):\r\n        self.container = None\r\n        try:\r\n            containers = self.client.containers(\r\n                filters={\"label\": f\"session_id={os.path.basename(self.session_path)}\"}, all=True)\r\n            if containers:\r\n                self.container = containers[0]\r\n                container_id = self.container.get('Id')\r\n                container_info = self.client.inspect_container(container_id)\r\n                if container_info.get('State', {}).get('Running') is False:\r\n                    self.client.start(container=container_id)\r\n                    self.wait_for_container_start(container_id)\r\n            else:\r\n                host_config = self.client.create_host_config(\r\n                    binds={self.session_path: {'bind': '/mnt/data', 'mode': 'rw'}}\r\n                )\r\n                \r\n                self.container = self.client.create_container(\r\n                    image=self.image_name,\r\n                    detach=True,\r\n                    labels={'session_id': os.path.basename(self.session_path)},\r\n                    host_config=host_config,\r\n                    user=\"docker\",\r\n                    stdin_open=True,\r\n                    tty=False\r\n                )\r\n\r\n                self.client.start(container=self.container.get('Id'))\r\n                self.wait_for_container_start(self.container.get('Id'))\r\n\r\n\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\njust remove the 'host_config' argument from the ```self.containers.create_container``` call. lmk how it goes.\n@unaidedelf8777 I uninstalled the previous wheel and reinstalled it, and also tried doing what you suggested above, by commenting the host_config related code. No improvement. Still facing the permission issue for directory creation. Could not find out why, I'm not sure, It may be due to my system setup. @ericrallen @nbbaier @KillianLucas Can you guys test this as well? \r\n\r\n```\r\nelse:\r\n                # host_config = self.client.create_host_config(\r\n                #     binds={self.session_path: {'bind': '/mnt/data', 'mode': 'rw'}}\r\n                # )\r\n                \r\n                self.container = self.client.create_container(\r\n                    image=self.image_name,\r\n                    detach=True,\r\n                    labels={'session_id': os.path.basename(self.session_path)},\r\n                    # host_config=host_config,\r\n                    user=\"docker\",\r\n                    stdin_open=True,\r\n                    tty=False\r\n                )\r\n\r\n                self.client.start(container=self.container.get('Id'))\r\n                self.wait_for_container_start(self.container.get('Id'))\r\n\r\n```\nThis is such a cool feature. I'm really excited about it and think you've done some amazing work here.\r\n\r\nI feel like this is getting really close. I left a few comments about some functionality, and then there's still some files that are unrelated but included in the PR, likely due to automated formatting in your editor.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have some issues with installing and using packages and also sometimes it can't seem to shutdown and cleanup the container after you hit `CTRL` + `C` to exit.\r\n\r\n![OpenInterpreter-Containers](https://github.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/assets/1667415/9b60c43a-0868-44fe-98c3-1a215b61dada)\nHey there, @unaidedelf8777!\r\n\r\nI would love to help get this one merged in as an MVP so that we can start incrementally improving so that we don't have to worry about so many merge conflicts.\r\n\r\nIf you need any help resolving the current conflicts, let me know. I'd be happy to pull down your branch and resolve them, or we could sync and walk through them together.\r\n\r\nOnce we have things shored up with the current state of the repo, I'd like to push for a merge since this functionality is essentially behind an experimental `--use_containers` flag and won't interfere with any regular user operations.\r\n\r\nThat should allow us to break out the remaining improvements and iterate on them more efficiently.",
    "sumarized_length": 1070,
    "summarized_comments": "This PR describes significant progress on containerized execution for the Open Interpreter (OI). Implementation of the `--use_container` and CLI functions `%upload` and `%download` is commendable; however, core concerns arise around Docker interaction and local testing. Specifically, users face issues such as the OpenAI API key not being passed to `litellm`, and difficulties in referencing local files due to containerization limits. There are persisting Docker permission errors when creating directories, likely stemming from Dockerfile misconfigurations.\n\nFeedback includes the notion of consolidating OI into a single Docker container for ease of use and potentially improved stability, though concerns around the complexity and file size (current image size is 1.81 GB) remain. Further suggestions entail minimizing changes to the codebase and tackling excessive file inclusions, potentially stemming from automated formatting. Calls for collaborative testing and iterations towards resolving issues in container creation and resource management were emphasized."

might check the bios settings, could also just be not a great motherboard as well.\n\nNo, it's not your slow video card.\nLlama.cpp was born to run models on CPUs, recently introduced acceleration with the GPU, but it's just speeding up some types of computation, it's not running the whole model on the GPU, so llama.cpp it's still CPU intensive. So your problem will definitely be limited by your CPU.\nIn my fork of this project I created a branch with HuggingFace hard-coded, that is, I wrote on the fly the implementation to load the models not in ggml format but in native model (so you have to download a model again if you don't have it), I do not remember if I did the commit to load them in 4bit using double quantization. In any case, be careful, that branch I did not create with the public in mind, but only try on my 6GB GPU of VRAM what it could do. But above all I did not care to fix it since today I have the physics exam at the university and I was preparing 😬\nAs soon as I have some time I'll fix that branch\n> Haven't tried this one but I was able to run the original(privateGPT) without problem on my mac M1 with 8G. Question: what would be the configuration in running this on my mac M1 with only have 8G?\r\n\r\nIt appears that the way in which llama.cpp loads and processes the model on M1 processors is different than on normal processors. So privateGPT without this pull request should still work fine for you. Unfortunately I don't have a MacBook available to give you any information, sorry\n@sime2408 \r\n\r\n> Any talks to run cuda inside docker? heard somewhere that it's possible\r\n\r\nThis is definitely possible.  I've used the tech you mention to deploy [instant-ngp](https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp) in a restricted environment that ran an older OS.   Performance was great, and forwarding the UI out of the container was also possible if you have a need for a GUI.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, it's also used by [cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) to streamline the deployment of ML models via docker containers. It attempts to make the packaging of the dependencies less of a headache.  Not sure if that system would suit the needs of this repo, but could be worth a look as well.\nI'm not a maintainer but I think it would be super helpful if you separate out all your changes and create separate PRs. That'll make it easier to test/evaluate in isolation and speed up merging!\r\n\r\nFor example, one PR just for performance improvements. One PR for translation. One PR for removing the example text. etc. etc.\n> I'm not a maintainer but I think it would be super helpful if you separate out all your changes and create separate PRs.

    "sumarized_length": 1044,
    "summarized_comments": "The comments in the PR raise several concrete technical issues and implementation concerns related to performance and installation steps. The use of `n_gpu_layers` and `use_mlock` needs clarification on their specific impact on performance metrics. Users reported installation challenges on a clean environment, necessitating additional manual package installations and encountering an `nvcc fatal: Value 'native' is not defined for option 'gpu-architecture'` error, indicating a potential issue with CUDA configurations. Additionally, the bash script for environment preparation needs further instructions on activation, especially for conda users. \n\nPerformance testing revealed minimal improvements with higher `n_gpu_layers`, suggesting underlying CPU limitations rather than GPU bottlenecks. Furthermore, it’s recommended to separate changes into multiple PRs for enhanced clarity and testability. Lastly, Docker options for CUDA deployment are mentioned, suggesting potential avenues for optimized model usage in constrained environments."

    "summarized_comments": "The PR raises several critical concerns and implementation suggestions. First, it is recommended to implement a `.env` configuration file to avoid modifying the repository's YAML files directly. For environmental variables, consider adopting the syntax `${MODELS:-./models}`. \n\nThere is confusion regarding the `load_dotenv(override=True)` functionality, as a `.env` file is currently absent. The commenter suggests that line endings for YAML files and the Dockerfile should be converted to LF to comply with `yamllint` standards.\n\nA significant architectural decision proposed is to merge the duplicated `docker-compose*.yaml` files into a single file using the `extend:` directive to avoid redundancy and simplify execution. Concerns about CUDA integration exhibit runtime errors due to unmet driver requirements, suggesting that the base image should be checked and potentially updated.\n\nAdditionally, there are issues with missing model files; an automatic model download mechanism has been included in the `entrypoint.sh` script to address this."

I would consider having two models in the prefs. One for use with GPU and a more modest one for CPU based ops. That way you could put the program and your data on a drive and take it with you, with no reconfiguration, running it on your laptop or other GPU limited machine when away from home.\r\n\r\nThat is also a good idea, I'm thinking of adding `GPU_MODEL_PATH` into the environment variables file in order to accomplish that.\r\n\r\n> 5. The estimation of memory used is one way to handle it, but as you noted in the comment you are depending on an estimate for a particular model that probably won't transfer all that well to other models either for the layers or the base memory cost of the LLM.\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any other way of accomplishing it feasibly, or even calculating and adjusting the GPU layers without rewriting the `langchain`'s `llama-cpp` implementation, though I do understand that that should not be overlooked. The current implementation in the proposal tries to get the most out of the GPU in a very questionable way.\r\n\r\n> 6.

Did you try the Embeddings GPU setting with the ingest process? It should make a big difference.

For the LlamaCpp there is a threads parameter that you can also pass that helps quite a bit with the performance of the part that is not accelerated by the GPU or if the GPU is not used at all. Adding -> n_threads=psutil.cpu_count(logical=False) <- to the parameter list will allow it to use the number of cores (not threads) as the thread count for the LLM.\r\n\r\nI avoided adding that because people that are running on low resources will get affected. On low-end computers like mine (with an i7-6700HQ) the device can get near unusable (my laptop crashes when it's on 100% for too long, and no it's not a cooling issue). Plus, since this PR is mostly about GPU acceleration/utilisation, I doubt that this would be the place to implement that?\r\n\r\n> 9. Good addition for the ## Using GPU acceleration. You picked an 11.8 version of cuda-kit which is a few steps back from what Nvidia would have you install from their site. Is there a reason to prefer this one?\r\n\r\nPyTorch supports only 11.7 and 11.8 currently. In order to not break anything (like user environments etc.) 11.8 was the pick. \r\n\r\n\n> In your README.md section, it looks like you need a: cd llama-cpp-python just before the: $Env:CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on\"; $Env:FORCE_CMAKE=1; py ./setup.py install else setup.py is not found.

Note that this is set to Real Core count, not Virtual Thread count. Thus, on your machine it would use 4 threads. You could also add an optional env value of max threads...  And it is a huge win on the machines that I run on.\r\nAs to the 'topicality' of the use-of-threads enhancement, you could always take advantage of the 'same line in the diff'-rule (like the '5-second' rule) to ask for a dispensation.\r\n\r\nBTW, I have an idea for accurate determination of memory requirements on the GPU for setting the layer counts.

When it is the running version you will see CUBLAS info at the bottom. Like this:\r\nllama_model_load_internal: mem required  = 9089.91 MB (+ 1608.00 MB per state)\r\nllama_model_load_internal: [cublas] offloading 10 layers to GPU\r\nllama_model_load_internal: [cublas] total VRAM used: 2269 MB\r\n\r\nThe CUBLAS lines will show even when the GPU is not active with the right version of LlamaCpp running.\r\n\r\n1. In my case, I was using VS Code and had some difficulty getting the LlamaCpp built, installed and active in the venv context.\r\n2. One thing that I encountered inside and outside the venv, was the need to uninstall the existing llama-cpp-python module and also to avoid reinstalling the old module from its cache.\r\nIt seemed best to do the uninstall, then build and install the LlamaCpp with the disable cache flag.\r\nUse a command similar to this:\r\npip install llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir\r\n3. Also, there is a lot of legacy python3 and pip3 references going around. These will screw you if you are not careful. At one time they were necessary to insure you did not get the python2 versions. Now, standard installs of python do not create python3 and pip3 versions so they fall further down the paths to some version that did. The end result is you don't get things installed into or built with the right python versions.\r\nYou can work around that two ways, create a link or dup the existing pip and python versions into pip3 and python3 in the active installation or remove the 3 from any commands you are executing.\r\n\r\nThose three things bit my hindquarters yesterday.\n> I am not sure why people are having troubles, I have actually ran on a clean Windows successfully, and also on several Linux machines...\r\n\r\nClean Windows? That is the definition of oxymoron.\r\nSeriously though, that is what you can test and you should test clean installations but much of these (or at least my) issues have to do with unclean installs, all the old python versions installed one place or another, all the subtle context interactions with IDEs, the slightly different versions installed for other packages or explorations, occasional lapses in the ability to follow instructions.\r\nThat is going to happen and about all you can do is perfect your instructions, embrace the suck, and get an installer going. The installer is good for about 80% of theses issues (by the 2nd or 3rd revision anyway).\r\n\r\n\n@johnbrisbin Thank you for the feedback. I am also trying to run it in VS code, in a venv. I have deleted the folder and environment and cloned so many times to start over the process.😤 I will try what you suggested regarding the cache. At least I know what I am looking for if it ever works. So you are saying using python3 and pip3 sometimes and then using python and pip can actually cause problems. Interesting. Thanks again. \n> @johnbrisbin Thank you for the feedback. I am also trying to run it in VS code, in a venv.

But for me, an active virtual environment seems to disable the where command so it outputs nothing. I had to run a simple script that imports sys and prints sys.argv[0] to find where the pythons are really located. And they were different.\n> > 13\\.

I've implemented it in [76f042a](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT/commit/76f042ae4c392ce0c4f84b8f81de339414a9ff3b) regardless. Further testing is welcome.\r\n\r\nSome really good news. Just turning on the CUDA option made a huge improvement for me. \r\n\r\nI have a collection of 1900+ epub books. I have ingested them more than once. It took 15 hours straight to ingest 1500 of them on a 16 core/32 thread 64GB machine at about 100 per hour.\r\nTurning on CUDA in the embeddings initialization with an RTX 1660 Super installed reduced the time for the first 100 from 1 hour to 8m57s with only 2 threads CPU load. The second 100 maintained the same pace, as did the third.\r\n\r\nIt looks like your very short test was dominated by initialization time. With a real load (the whole 1900 books amount to 3.75 million chunks) the benefits are huge! 7x faster. Since the machine I have is very fast for CPU ops, the benefits for people with less capable main processors will be even better assuming a normal video card.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, @maozdemir ",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR review highlights several technical issues and implementation suggestions. \n\n1. **Build Instructions**: The README.md lacks a critical step; a `cd llama-cpp-python` command should precede the install command to ensure the setup.py is found. The cmake version needs to be noted, as builds fail without explicit version requirements. \n\n2. **Memory Management**: The current method of scraping nvidia-smi for GPU memory may lead to security risks. Consider using the `pycuda` library for robust GPU memory management.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement a warning for GPT4ALL that allows it to continue execution even if it detects a GPU environment flag. This prevents unnecessary script failures.\n\n4. **Thread Management**: Consider implementing a threads parameter to utilize available CPU cores. This would improve performance, especially on low-resources machines.\n\n5. **CUDA Versions**: Clarify rationale for using CUDA 11.8 as it may be outdated for future compatibility. Additionally, include guidance for installing PyTorch with CUDA in the requirements.\n\n6. **Environment Documentation**: Improve documentation related to environment variables for model configurations to help users set up efficiently. \n\nOverall, consider addressing these points to enhance usability and performance."

It suggests removing the fingerprinting library, which currently strips response data, to enable access to raw responses. The identifier `b'Power Steering System '` was criticized for lacking specific versioning or car information, prompting exploration of better identifiers from the ECU description query (`22 F1 97`). The use of `SUBARU_VERSION_REQUEST` (22 F1 82) is noted for extracting FPv2 firmware values, yet missing or negative responses persist. A delay in the diagnostic queries (10 seconds) produced varied results, showing inconsistent responses across tests. Furthermore, there are indications of response handling issues in the current implementation, especially related to waiting for response statuses. The request to set `debug=True` during failed ECU queries may help clarify these inconsistencies. The PR also plans to gate the delay by VIN checks for Subaru models."

I understand that there may be some vehicles that respond differently from the few cars I've tested, and it would be a significant effort to retune every car.  However, it seems that the introduction of INDI creates an opportunity to greatly improve lateral performance for the vehicles that currently perform poorly with the existing logic.  If a new planning type was added for vehicles that perform better with this delta based on actual angle, then the type could be chosen at the time the vehicle is tuned for INDI.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it seems that my prior PR for deadzone in pathplanner should be evaluated.\nAfter thinking more about the comment from @rbiasini, it seems that there is a significant overlap in \"roles\" between pathplanner and latcontrol.  It seems that pathplanner is using desired angle to communicate torque, and latcontrol is converting that into a torque request with some PID calculations.  Forthermore, it seems that the current logic treats path error as torque error AND latcontrol's PID logic does the same.  I think this is a fundamental flaw, especially when the pathplan is updated at a different frequency AND neither process is considering the actual steer rate reported by the EPS.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the correct approach would be to output a desired angle (as it does now) that is intended to be the primary control by \"angle type\" systems, and a desired rate that is primary control for \"torque type\" systems.  Desired angle should only be used as a **_secondary_** measure for torque type systems.\r\n\r\nIf torque type steering systems were using rate-based feedforwared the bias / offset issues would be eliminated.  I submitted a PR for that months ago.  **_Here:_** https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/pull/593\n>  It seems that pathplanner is using desired angle to communicate torque, and latcontrol is converting that into a torque request with some PID calculations\r\n\r\nNot really. pathplanner communicates angle. Angle to torque is done is done by latcontrol alone, which can either be PID or INDI.\r\n\r\n>  Forthermore, it seems that the current logic treats path error as torque error\r\n\r\nNot sure what you mean: the only way to go back into the desired path is to apply some torque, which is what the low level controller (PID or INDI) does. Moreover, path error is used by the vehicle model parameter estimator to fix the errors in model parameters.\r\n\r\n> neither process is considering the actual steer rate reported by the EPS\r\n\r\nINDI controller considers the steer rate directly. PID (or any other closed loop linear controller... feel free to put as many poles and zeros as you want) could also do the same.\r\n\r\n> t seems that the correct approach would be to output a desired angle (as it does now) that is intended to be the primary control by \"angle type\" systems, and a desired rate that is primary control for \"torque type\" systems.\r\n\r\nI'm all in favor for a steer-rate based feedforward to add to the existing angle based feedforward. They are both true things of the torque that needs to be applied in order to move steering wheel and keep it at an angle, respectively. Let me re-read the PR you mentioned.\r\n\r\n\n> Not really. pathplanner communicates angle. Angle to torque is done is done by latcontrol alone, which can either be PID or INDI.\r\n\r\nI agree that pathplanner is communicating angle, but that angle is apparently derived using the input delta + new desired rate.  I recall a conversation with @pd0wm about mpc interpolation, and he indicated that the MPC is rate based.  \r\n\r\nAfter more specific testing using PID and INDI to compare the results with standard pathplanner as well as with the proposed fixes.  Both forms of control exhibited the same behavior with respect to desired angle.  The desired angle becomes exaggerated with standard logic, which results in more noise in the actual steering angle.\r\n\r\nHere is a side-by-side comparison using my 2018 Honda Accord with PID.  Take note of the magnitude of the angle error graph at the bottom for each.  Also note that I have to provide steering assistance several times, since this road requires more steering torque than my Accord will provide.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6308011/59713910-143bc100-91d6-11e9-8993-4aa87311499e.png)\r\n\r\nHere is the same with INDI\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6308011/59713992-36cdda00-91d6-11e9-9ef3-2f0d14078206.png)\r\n\nJust wanted to report that this \"hack\" allows me to use the instant angle offset, which dramatically helps center the car and make up for any vehicle model issues. I'm running INDI and my car is now perfectly centered, even on roads with excessive camber (which was a huge issue before). I don't quite understand why feeding MPC the actual state of the vehicle is a no-no in MPC control theory for this application, but I haven't noticed any negative effects.\r\n\r\nOh, I'm also running 0.0 costs for Path, Heading and Rate, lowering costs really helps cornering performance for me (this is completely unrelated). I also have a 0.005 degree custom angle sensor on my Prius, so YMMV - although I did have a totally factory Prius user try it at 0 cost and said that I finally fixed INDI centering issues: https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/compare/devel...zorrobyte:devel_zorrosteer\nOn another note... After some discussion on Discord, I realized that I should provide a more detailed \"zoomed in\" view of the same long turn using PID with and without this bug fix.  Below is a long right-handed curve that my 2018 Honda Accord can barely make, due to torque limitations.  The graphs make it look like a few broken curves, but it is actually 1 very long curve.  \r\n\r\nWithout this bug fix, the desired angle \"ratchets up\" way beyond what it really needs, so the steering very slowly approaches the angle that's actually needed.  If the model was perfect, the torque request would taper off smoothly so that the car would find the center of the lane and stay there.  However, this bug causes the car to eventually cross the center of the lane, which triggers the MPC to reverse the steer rate the other way.  This causes the torque to cut out, resulting in a huge over-correction that virtually blows the corner.  This happens often on long curves, and I often have to grab the steering wheel to prevent running into the car or curb next to me.\r\n\r\nOn the right-hand side, the same curve is shown WITH this bug fix.  As you can see, the corrections are much less aggressive, but still exist.  I think that some work is still needed to prevent the over-corrections that are still occurring, but this is the best I've ever experienced without exotic compensations.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6308011/59733304-16704080-9213-11e9-9d8f-9256274f74f5.png)\r\n\nWhen you plot the desired MPC trajectory on the same plot it is very clear what happens:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1314752/59805824-39e4cb00-92a7-11e9-80a5-b7c16d4bd959.png)\r\nOn this plot the trajectory as calculated on t = 5137.6 is plotted on the future states. This corresponds to t=11:51:50 on your plot.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is to make this work you had to decrease steerRateCost. This allows the plan to change the angle a lot within one timestep, about 2.5 degrees in 0.05 s. However this plan is not physical and has nothing to what will actually be executed downstream. Because of this huge change within the first timestep the PID controller will actually send out torque.\r\n\nIf I'm understanding the diagram that @pd0wm shared, I can see how this change makes the projected path invalid.  From a data processing and model training standpoint, I can see that being an issue.  However, from the controls point of view, the only thing that matters is the first desired angle.  The 19 desired angles that come after that first angle are not used for controls.\r\n\r\nHere is a rough sketch of what I think would occur with existing logic (on the left) when the actual angle doesn't execute fast enough to achieve the desired angle vs the proposed logic (on the right).  The first desired angle in each MPC update is what controls would try to execute, which are contained in the red boxes.\r\n\r\nI think it's pretty easy to see how the current logic would be problematic for low-response actuators, since the \"stacked\" plans essentially create a tsunami of missed execution.  That also explains why Toyota's use such high steer rate costs with standard logic, so that the tsunami is less destructive.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6308011/59864096-b4ffbd00-934b-11e9-9471-40509a90c52e.png)\r\n\nYes, your diagram is correct, however on the right the magnitude will also become larger if the commanded angle is not actually executed. Even though the 19 other timesteps might not be directly used for control, the whole horizon is taken into account for the optimization problem in MPC. If the projected plan from MPC is not actually exectutable this optimization doesn't make sense anymore.\r\n\r\nThe 0th timestep in MPC should be the point from where you can output any control action. If you would use the delay you are missing one timestep of control action. Once I have time to finish the interpolation, we can actually use angles between timesteps.\r\n\r\nIf this change makes driving better we should try to figure out what is better about the angles that are outputted. Changing the starting state is not the solution. I think if the MPC plan is more \"realistic\", e.g. it can actually followed by PID/INDI, the overall results will be better.\r\n\r\nOne thing I see happening is that once steering angles become larger, the error between desired and actual angle becomes bigger. On way to try to solve this, is that we could put a higher cost on changing the angle when the angle is already relatively large.\nI agree that the angles would grow when the actuator delay is preventing actual execution.  However, for actuators that have more than 0.05 second latency, it seems better for that to occur.  \r\n\r\nIf I had a Toyota myself, I would test it before posting about it, but my thought is that it might be more effective to reduce steerRateCost to a reasonable value, like 0.5, but use an interpolated target angle further down the desired path as the desired angle for controls.  It seems that would create a much more achievable target.\r\n\r\nIf that approach would be more desirable for you, I'll pursue it.  However, the cur_states[0].delta would still need to be set to the actual angle to prevent the tsunami.\nThe tsunami isn't as bad as you think. It's not just growing all the time. If you share the drive for the left plot I can plot the actual values. I'll also plot multiple plans, so we don't have to guess.\r\n\r\nThe Prius is already down to 0.5. The better low-level controls is, the lower the steerRate cost can be. But as long as the plan is still moving faster than the actuator can move, we can't do that.\r\n\r\nWe can't choose a later delta, because MPC will think the control actions it computes between t=0 and t=actuatorDelay will actually be executed, but they won't.\nLooking at the paths you shared, it looks like using any of the first few indexes would have the effect of increasing response.  The actuator wouldn't actually reach those angles before the next MPC update, but it would be well on its way.  \nYeah, that looks like what I was thinking.  However, it looks like there's about 10 degrees of error (20 vs 10), which blocks integration and doesn't unwind well as paths converge.\r\n\r\nI set steerRateCost back to standard value of 0.5 (all other costs are standard), and extended the MPC interpolation by 0.1 seconds (between 2nd and 3rd delta).  This worked very well, especially for unwind.  I don't think my car has ever done this curve as well as.\r\n\r\nThe dark blue line is the interpolated (and smoothed) target angle that is used for PID.  The cabana drive still seems to be processing, but here is the link.\r\n\r\nhttps://my.comma.ai/cabana/?route=ddd3e089e7bbe0fc%7C2019-06-20--16-32-00&max=25&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchffrprivate-vzn.azureedge.net%2Fchffrprivate3%2Fv2%2Fddd3e089e7bbe0fc%2F476fa32df3c9ed3acd3a95924cd70118_2019-06-20--16-32-00\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6308011/59884903-3755a480-937f-11e9-9310-7de0549beefc.png)\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment discusses the potential for introducing a new steering or planning type to improve lateral performance for vehicles struggling under the current logic. It suggests leveraging the capabilities of the INDI system, allowing for angular retuning at tuning time rather than retuning each vehicle individually. Key concerns include the overlap of roles between pathplanner and latcontrol, where pathplanner communicates desired angles while latcontrol translates these to torque requests. The comment identifies a fundamental flaw in treating path error as torque error, overlooking the actual steer rate reported by EPS. \n\nAn alternative proposed approach involves using a desired angle for \"angle-type\" systems and a desired rate for \"torque-type\" systems, recommending a steer-rate based feedforward to eliminate bias issues. The comment emphasizes the need for realistic MPC outputs and hints towards practical gas costs adjustments for improved system performance."

Here is the original vs TFLite model.\r\nOriginal\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25496969/96834581-770f1f00-13ff-11eb-8662-230862d17552.jpg)\r\nTFLite\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25496969/96834598-7e362d00-13ff-11eb-9377-7522b86f1467.jpg)\r\n\r\n\n@idenc From the two images, my first guess is the anchors have been changed.\r\nCould you check whether the anchors have been changed by `auto anchor`?\r\nJust compare anchors from *.yaml files and \r\nthe trained model anchors with\r\n```\r\nprint(torch.load('your_custom_model.pt')['model'].model[-1].anchors)\r\n```\r\nas in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/447#issuecomment-664698219.\r\n\r\nIf `auto anchor` have changed the anchors, that won't be reflected in *.yaml config file from which TFLite export is generated.\r\n\r\nThe follwing code changes anchors by `auto anchor`:\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/83deec133d62021b496ba6cc475c38e717098053/train.py#L192-L193\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/83deec133d62021b496ba6cc475c38e717098053/utils/general.py#L109-L110\r\n\r\nThat's the reason why `auto anchor` affects detection boxes.\r\nIf it is the case, you could substitute the anchors within your *.yaml file with auto generated anchors and try TFLite export and detection again.\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nCould you check your custom model using PyTorch inference?\r\nWhich `--img` did you use to export the TFLite model?\r\n\r\nReference for auto anchor generation: \r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/503\r\n\r\n\n@zldrobit @idenc yes the model anchors may no longer be equal to the yaml definition for a variety of reasons. To access current model anchors:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nmodel = torch.load('yolov5s.pt')['model']\r\n\r\nm = model.model[-1]  # Detect()\r\nm.anchors  # in stride units\r\nm.anchor_grid  # in pixel units\r\n\r\nprint(m.anchor_grid.view(-1,2))\r\ntensor([[ 10.,  13.],\r\n        [ 16.,  30.],\r\n        [ 33.,  23.],\r\n        [ 30.,  61.],\r\n        [ 62.,  45.],\r\n        [ 59., 119.],\r\n        [116.,  90.],\r\n        [156., 198.],\r\n        [373., 326.]])\r\n```\r\n/rebase\n@Sergey-sib I guess you mean the `best.pt` is the full model.\r\nActually, it is stored in fp16 precision.\r\nDespite the difference of PyTorch and TFLite, the size of `best.pt` is approximately equal to the size of `best-fp16.tflite`, .\r\n\r\n",
    "sumarized_length": 1252,
    "summarized_comments": "This PR discussion highlights several concrete technical issues and suggestions. First, the distinction between fixed input size versus square inference requirements in TensorFlow is clarified, with `auto=False` set in `letterbox` for consistent image sizes during preprocessing. The error encountered while loading the model on an Android emulator reveals an issue with tensor allocations, specifically stemming from a mismatch in expected input counts for an ADD operation: \"NumInputs(node) != 2 (1 != 2)\". \n\nTo resolve this, it's recommended to change the input size in `DetectorFactory.java` to accommodate specific resolutions for TFLite, to optimize performance. Moreover, concerns about different resolution handling being hardcoded in `tf.py` have been addressed, indicating that `640` is a default value adjustable via `--img`.\n\nAdditionally, the requirement to add TensorFlow and other dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file has been noted, along with instructions for exporting models at a custom size (320x192) suitable for specific aspect ratios. Finally, there is a noteworthy recommendation to verify anchor configurations in custom models post-training, ensuring they align with TFLite exports to avoid discrepancies in detections."

    "summarized_comments": "This PR discussion covers multiple technical concerns and implementation suggestions. A key point is the proposal to add a `--deterministic` flag in `train.py` to address non-determinism in CUDA with bilinear interpolation used in segmentation. Merging `non_max_suppression_masks()` with `non_max_suppression()` is suggested to reduce maintenance and enhance code efficiency, although the author initially separated them for future-proofing across different tasks. The removal of the `edict` dependency in favor of native dictionaries is confirmed. Profiling with COCO reveals that CPU NMS is significantly slower, suggesting the GPU to CPU transfer impacts performance. A potential drop in mAP during training is flagged, linked to NMS alignment changes. Lastly, there's a consensus not to uncomment generator lines, as they reduce accuracy, affecting reproducibility across both segment and detection loaders. The implementation of these suggestions needs to prioritize code efficiency and performance metrics."

Any idea how to fix this?\r\n\n@brunovollmer It seems that the number of classes has changed in your conversion. The default number of classes is 80. You could use `--cfg` to provide your config file to `detect.py` with a different number of classes.\nHello, I tried this code and have question\r\n\r\n1) `python3 models/tf.py --weights yolov5s.pt ... --no-tfl-detect ... ...`\r\n`python3 detect.py --weights yolov5s-int8_edgetpu.tflite ... --tfl-detect ...`\r\nUse '--no-tfl-detect' when converting, '--tfl-detect' when running.\r\nIt seems to have the opposite meaning when using. No problem?\r\n\r\n \r\n2) CPU 100% load when running detection(--source : video). I use USB Accelerator, no GPU.\r\nThe conversion is done, but I can't apply it to my code. It seems that pytorch's cpu tensor is used. Can I solve the CPU load problem in my environment?\r\n\nHello @ksp7518 \r\n1. It may be confusing for using two opposite names, yet I hope the nomenclature is clear. `--no-tfl-detect` in conversion means not to include the detect module (reconstruction of boxes) in TFLite models, and `--tfl-detect` in detect means to reconstruct bboxes after inference. So if you converted a model with `--no-tfl-detect`, you have to infer the model with `--tfl-detect`.\r\n\r\n2. `detect.py` uses PyTorch NMS, you could replace the NMS with numpy operations to avoid using PyTorch tensors (needs some code modification), but also note that a small part of the EdgeTPU model runs on CPU.\n@zldrobit I found a similar issue with converting larger models. In the past, it seemed the compiler (v15) would have no problem deferring some of the later operations to CPU. With v16, this isn't the case and the compiler will just refuse because of large activation tensors, so this may be a regression on the EdgeTPU side. I was only able to export up to 224 px with a full model (detect built-in) as a result and trying to compiler larger models without the detect layer doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\nAlso yes - see here for a CPU/pure numpy NMS implementation https://github.com/jveitchmichaelis/edgetpu-yolo/blob/main/nms.py.\nSorry for the late answer. The commands are:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3 models/tf.py --weights $WEIGHTS --cfg $CONFIG --img 224 --no-tfl-detect --tfl-int8 --tf-raw-resize --source $COCO --ncalib 100\r\npython3 detect.py --weight

    "summarized_comments": "Concerns raised in the PR highlight breaking changes due to reordering the Focus layer, which would impact backward compatibility for model loading. It was reported that multiple TensorFlow versions (2.4.1, 2.5.0, tf-nightly) were attempted for model conversion, yet errors persisted, including a `NameError` regarding the undefined `keras_model` and issues with `Conv2D` object attributes. It was noted that the YOLOv5 model's class count discrepancies (default 80 vs. customized) may exacerbate export problems. Suggested solutions include ensuring that the `--cfg` argument is correctly utilized to match class counts during detection. Additionally, inefficient CPU loads during detection with USB Accelerator were noted, recommending a switch to NumPy operations for non-maximum suppression (NMS) to alleviate dependency on PyTorch. Lastly, user feedback indicated the necessity of updating documentation regarding command parameters for clarity."

The inference times for both fp16 and int8 models were documented, noting significant CPU inference time reductions, but concerns were raised about int8 models experiencing slower GPU inference times compared to fp16.\n\nIt was advised that users verify representative calibration images and adjust input tensor shapes when encountering incompatibility errors in the Android integration. The addition of documentation for Android integration was also requested for clarity. A follow-up PR is expected to address the code integration without the Android folder to ease maintenance."

Hopefully the bug is occurring during the calculation of maps with deterministic algorithms. I'll verify if the model is actually learning anything or not by plotting results in each epoch. \n@glenn-jocher The error is with calculation.

    "summarized_comments": "In reviewing the PR from @AyushExel, several critical technical issues and suggestions emerged:\n\n1. **Performance Comparison**: It is essential to provide before-and-after results demonstrating performance variances across three runs from the master and three from the PR. The tests should utilize COCO128 YOLOv5s over 30 epochs to establish a reliable baseline.\n\n2. **Dataloader Initialization**: The `init_fn` in the dataloader currently lacks Python and PyTorch seed initialization, which is crucial for reproducibility. This needs to be rectified as per guidance from official PyTorch documentation.\n\n3. **Deterministic Algorithms**: Utilizing `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms()` poses risks, including potential runtime errors with certain operations and non-exception safety. Setting the `warn_only` flag to True may lead to silent failures in reproducibility, requiring careful consideration.\n\n4. **Validation Anomalies**: A specific line causing erroneous behavior when deterministic algorithms are enabled was identified. Adjustments to scope when setting the deterministic flag improved reproducibility but necessitate further verification across larger datasets.\n\n5. **Detailed Experimentation**: Future experiments should include variations such as training with `workers=0` and disabling Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), with tracked results to pinpoint performance differences.\n\nImmediate action includes revising the dataloader's `init_fn` and curating comparative performance runs while addressing the deterministic algorithm concerns for further validation of model training outcomes."

Since you are looking to add CI, I would like to suggest to update the unit tests to train in different mode (CPU,1GPU, DP, DDP), like I've done above, as the original code only trained on 2 GPU.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Ok this is a bit complicated.

The reason the code is like that is because our branch is always behind with the constant changes with master.\nHello glenn, the tests I did above are without SyncBatchNorm (off by default), so I was curious whether it could improve accuracy using it. Here are the results.\r\n\r\n![results (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/87794811-620b7880-c871-11ea-889e-06a9f5d7baab.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![results (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/87794787-5750e380-c871-11ea-8631-e4f9211a0d54.png)\r\n\r\nIn summary, it shows itself to be more noticeable at higher GPUs (when the individual GPUs has small batchsizes <= 8). I asked MagicFrogSJTU about this, and he said the below.\r\n\r\n> when total_batch_size is the same, DDP with SyncBN should have similar performance with default-single-gpu.\r\n> SyncBN is not of no cost. It would slow down the training speed. And for most cases with 2, 4 gpus, the performance difference is negligible. Therefore, I think SyncBN shouldn't be the default.\r\n> I think we should edit the README.md to provide how to activate DDP model and when and how should SyncBN is applied. You can discuss it with Glenn! I am currently out of hand!\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/MagicFrogSJTU/yolov5/issues/7#issuecomment-660111734\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Though in a real case scenario, I don't think someone would set their total batchsize to be 64 on 8 GPUs.\r\n\n@NanoCode012 that's interesting. SBN is clearly helping in your scenario, which is great to confirm, but I think the reality is more complicated. \r\n\r\nMulti-gpu using the same batch-size as single-gpu would surely have reduced batch-computation statistics, in which case SBN would help. But if you have multiple gpus, you would be wise to double your batch size correspondingly, in which case each gpu may still be computing BN stats on a similar number of images. In this case of scaling batch-size with gpus it's much less clear to me that SBN will help. What do you think? Also what's the speed overhead of using it vs not using it?\r\n\r\nI had a quick question. Just to confirm, the training commands are here, are these correct? It looks like we'll need to make a tutorial for multi-gpu now to explain this to people.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 1-gpu\r\npython train.py --data coco.yaml  --batch 64 --cfg yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --epochs 300 --device 0\r\n\r\n# 2-GPU 'DP' or existing way:\r\npython train.py --data coco.yaml  --batch 64 --cfg yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --epochs 300 --device 0,1\r\n\r\n# 2-GPU DDP\r\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node 2 train.py --data coco.yaml  --batch 64 --cfg yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --epochs 300 --device 0,1\r\n\r\n# 2-GPU DDP with SyncBN\r\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node 2 train.py --data coco.yaml  --batch 64 --cfg yolov5s.yaml --weights '' --epochs 300 --device 0,1 --sync-bn\r\n```\r\n",

First, it's proposed that simpler commits, specifically related to Dockerfile and README updates, be grouped into smaller PRs to enhance merge speed. There’s commendation for the argparser that allows relative paths for files. Epoch train times were noted using T4 GPUs, indicating performance trends, with a recommendation to replicate tests on the PR branch.\n\nRegarding multi-GPU setups, commands for Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) mode need clarification—transitioning to DDP for multiple GPUs via `torch.distributed.launch` is required. It’s pointed out that while DDP improves training speed, using SyncBatchNorm might introduce overhead. Lastly, there’s uncertainty about the necessity of some checks in the training script since EMA is now single-GPU focused. A suggestion is made for unit tests to cover various configurations and yield insights on performance implications of using SyncBatchNorm."

Concerns were raised regarding logging failures when an empty weights file is specified, leading to an `IsADirectoryError`. It was suggested to modify the logging check to ensure it verifies the existence and type of the weights file. Additionally, `mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"sqlite:///mlruns.db\")` should be added in `train.py` to facilitate database connection. Users reported version discrepancies with MLflow, mentioning difficulties in running commands due to incorrect directories, which may indicate a larger issue with version compatibility. Recommendations to address this involve ensuring correct directory paths when invoking `mlflow run` commands. Overall, these suggestions aim to improve functionality and mitigate errors in the integration process."

(shift.values != nullptr) : (shift.values == nullptr)\r\n\r\nThanks\nHello @tujh2 , @sctrueew ! This is Roudy, Ahmad's Co-worker.\r\n\r\n@tujh2 your problem is due to OpenCV's inference engine. It does not support all the operators that ONNX officially supports. OpenCV tries to unify several formats under 1 inference engine (such as OpenVINO, ONNX, Caffe....) so they try to support all the common operators that are shared across the libraries and frameworks. Also, the Mul problem is due to the same limitation.\r\nUnfortunately, there is no direct fix from our end for this. To make it work, either OpenCV will have to add that operator in their next versions, or, we would have to re-work all the detection head to try and workaround this operator, which obviously isn't the best course of action here.\r\nYou can run the model using ONNX runtime though, pre-process and post-process normally like you do in an OpenCV inference scenario but you just have to change the actual inference code. It shouldn't be that much of a difference for you.\r\n\r\n@sctrueew yes this model works with TensorRT. You have 2 options:\r\n\r\n1. Export a model in this repo by using `python export.py --weights /Path/To/Weights.pt --imgsz ImageSize --device 'cpu' --simplify --include engine`. This will directly export a .engine file without going through wts first.\r\n2. Export model to ONNX format and build the .engine file from there.\r\n\r\nWe didn't try running the models in TensorRT C++. However, we deploy our models using ONNX format with the TensorRT execution provider which automatically converts the ONNX model to .engine then runs inference on the .engine so I believe it should work normally in TensorRT C++ if ONNX can run it.\n> I keep getting load_image is not defined error even though it should be imported from utils/datasets ? Any help ?

And it does not fail on Mul operator too.\r\nThe graph after exporting does not contain ScatterND operators. \r\n<details>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24863565/154113365-23669949-16db-44da-a0e4-07f77297fbcf.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nAlso I have a question about `Polygon_Detect._make_grid()` func\r\nOpenCV fails on `forward()` step. I've got the same error as in https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/20072 \r\nI just copied original `_make_grid()` func from `Detect` and this helped. \r\nNow I can use polygon model with OpenCV and this working fine (I have custom inference pipeline in c++ and opencv, so I don't use detect.py)\r\n\r\nAlso I don't know if this changes are correct, but I'll leave that question to you :shrug: \n@tujh2 Careful of removing that `y[..., 8:] = y[..., 8:].sigmoid()`, it is there to make sure that all the outputs are within the [0..1] range. Without it the model might output values outside of that range which will go out of bounds of the image. You should be able to remedy that in post processing but we thought of leaving it there to include that step directly in the model and save the user from an extra step at post processing. I think it is also present in the master branch for the same reason (clamping values between 0..1), @glenn-jocher can correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nAs for the  `_make_grid()` function I'm glad that it worked fine for you! Thank you for pointing that swapping it with `Detect`'s function fixed it! We'll do some further testing to make sure that swapping the functions won't have any hidden unwanted effect, if all goes well we'll then update the PR with the original `_make_grid()`.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're on C++ I recommend swapping your inference engine to TensorRT, your pre and post processing steps will remain almost the same and you'll get a significant speedup in your pipeline.\n@RoudyES Hi,\r\n\r\nI've converted the model to onnx and when I want to do inference in C++ I get this error:\r\n\r\n(-2:Unspecified error) Can't create layer \"416\" of type \"Range\" in function 'cv::dnn::dnn4_v20211004::LayerData::getLayerInstance'\r\n\r\nDo you have a sample to use in C++ on onnx or TensorRT?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\n@sctrueew it seems to me that you tried to run inference using OpenCV's DNN module. If so, please refer to @tujh2's comment above. They made some slight changes and were able to run the model with OpenCV's DNN.\r\n\r\nHowever, I recommend running ONNX models using ONNX Runtime. Also, if you compile onnx runtime from source with TensorRT execution provider you will be able to run the same .onnx model with TensorRT backend without changing your code (the runtime will automatically convert the onnx model to .engine). Or you can just export the .pt model into .engine using `export.py`.\r\n\r\nAs for the sample, I'm afraid we don't have a C++ snippet.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment raises critical issues regarding the ONNX model compatibility with OpenCV, specifically the unsupported `ScatterND` operator, leading to parse errors on model import (noted in the logs). Additionally, there's a similar limitation with the `Mul` operator when constants are involved, identified as unsolvable without updates to OpenCV's inference engine. It is advisable to either modify the model to work around unsupported operators or switch to ONNX Runtime for inference, which typically avoids these issues.\n\nThe comment suggests a potential solution that involves removing the `sigmoid` operation in the `forward()` method, noting that this change enables successful model reading in OpenCV. However, this alteration raises concerns about output value normalization. Testing of the modified `_make_grid()` function from the `Detect` class is also suggested as a workaround for errors during the forward pass. Finally, the user receives confirmation that moving to TensorRT could enhance performance without significant changes to existing inference setups."

We should remove them if not necessary, thanks!\r\n```python\r\n        x2b_t = min(x2b, w)\r\n        y2b_t = min(y2b, h)\r\n        x2a = x2a - (x2b - x2b_t)\r\n        y2a = y2a - (y2b - y2b_t)\r\n        x2b = x2b_t\r\n        y2b = y2b_t\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

I removed the psutil dependency from requirements.txt since we don't want to burden users with extra packages. \r\n\r\nThis displays storage and type on caching (i.e. caching (1GB disk) or (1GB ram)).\r\n\r\nThis implementation also places an _npy directory right next to the default images directory using the same logic as the existing *.cache file commands. \r\n\r\nI think the main problem here is that this will cache the entire dataset every time training starts, regardless of whether it's already been cached. We need smarter logic to check for this and skip npy files already present.\nOk I implemented smart logic in to avoid loading and saving new npy files if they already exist (on a case by case basis) in 7c51880\n@glenn-jocher \r\nThx!\r\nAll cases work correctly.\r\n```\r\npython train.py\r\npython train.py --cache \r\npython train.py --cache ram\r\npython train.py --cache disk\r\n```\r\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ljCmXjdCVVpySCqOjLLKkyFIaiMs7GsG?usp=sharing#scrollTo=ujqVMkKKwNJX",

I didn't write this as an issue on github as the integration is not merged in master, hence it's not reproducible. \r\nHere's my problem. I'm trying to resume a run from a checkpoint saved as an artifact. But I'm not able to load the model. The surprising part is that the same code works perfectly for coco128 dataset but it's throwing an error for voc.here is the error log.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot (494)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15766192/109397619-9560ca80-795d-11eb-9c57-82803d871610.png)\r\nAs you can see the weights are transferred successfully but the ema operation throws a size mismatch error. The most surprising part is that this same code works fine with coco128 dataset. \r\nAny thoughts on why this is happening? If it's something obvious, I'll be able to fix it before our meeting tomorrow.\r\n\r\nEdit-- more context --> The dataset being used is also saved as an artifact. It is the same folder that is generated from `get_voc.sh` . Again, this same process worked well with coco128 dataset \n@AyushExel ah interesting. Right, so since last time we talked I made a major update to the checkpointing system in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/2292, and then applied two fixes related to this PR in #2295 and #2317. Before checkpoints saved the EMA as the model, which on resume caused a problem, since `model` was resuming from `EMA` rather than from the previous model (model info should only ever flow one way, to the EMA).\r\n\r\nThis is fixed now, so new checkpoints carry 1) model fp16, 2) ema fp16, 3) optimizer fp32, and each simply resumes from the checkpoint.\r\n\r\nThe error clearly originates in a differing class count (VOC has 10 and COCO/COCO128 have 80), but I don't know why it's happening. You may be trying to resume an 80 class model with a 10 class dataset or vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis might be simply due to the fact that the current resume only supports interrupted resuming (no changes in data or architecture), vs starting a training from pretrained weights, which supports changes in architecture, class counts, datasets, etc. Not sure if that helps or not?\n\n@glenn-jocher I actually changed the resume functionality to be compatible with current master. You can only resume interrupted runs. And this is one of those case where the run is interrupted. Although I think this changing only the dataset should not cause any error and all my debugging efforts didn't lead me anywhere, I'll try again tomorrow.\n\nBtw here's the workflow.\n**Working:**\n`python train.py --save_period 1 --data coco128.yaml`\nInterrupt it\n`python train.py --resume wandb-artifact://project/run_id`\n\nThis works perfectly.\n\n**not working**\n`python train.py --save_period 1 --data voc.yaml`\nInterrupt it\n`python train.py --resume wandb-artifact://project/run_id\nThis throws error.\n\nBtw, can you make out something from the error msg? Like what exactly might be going wrong here the size of input expected ? I'm pretty the number of classes and names is saved in wandb.config file, so that should not cause the issue\n@AyushExel ok got it. Well the workflow looks good!!\r\n\r\nYes, the sizes are incorrect, the 3 layers shown are the Detect() convolutions for P3, P4, P5. The output size for COCO is normally 255 (80+5 per anchor times 3 anchors). VOC for example would have (10+5 per anchor, so the VOC value there should be 45, not sure where the 75 comes from in the error message, that's a mystery).\r\n\r\nIn any case, the EMA and the model have identical structure, everything exactly the same, and in your error the checkpoint EMA and the current EMA should also be of equal architecture. Maybe you started the artifact a few days ago and some of the recent PR changes are interfering. Can you delete all of the artifacts (dataset and model) and git clone the latest and try again? I'll try to resume VOC using master to verify.\r\n\r\nEDIT: 75 could be produced by a VOC model with 5 anchors per layer... (10+5 * 5 anchors)\n@glenn-jocher I finally found the issue. By default the data_dict is loaded from coco128, which caused this problem. To fix that, data_dict is saved in wandb.config object. When resuming runs, we can just set data_dict = wandb.config.data_dict.  Now, the resume from artifacts is working fine. \r\n![Screenshot (497)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15766192/109413572-25d9f200-79d4-11eb-92dd-df8e5faf049e.png)\r\nThe workaround has limitations. Like what if the data.yaml file is a custom file and is not present in the repo? In that case the loader will throw an error before reaching wandb.config object that has the required info, here.\r\n![Screenshot (499)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15766192/109413647-7c473080-79d4-11eb-9630-3ecae69faba3.png)\r\nMaybe check-in that opt.data is_file() before loading will be better. \r\nAnyway, right now I'm working on building the functionality(almost done). We can clean it up once functionality is don.\n> TODO/Look into list:\r\n> \r\n> * instead of passing --data coco128_wandb.yaml, search for coco128.yaml --> Path('coco128_wandb.yaml').isfile() and use instead\r\n> * add --upload-dataset argument to train.py to remove need to call to log_datasets.py\r\n> * remove --log-imgs and assume hard coded 16.\r\n> * suggested resume command python train.py `--resume wandb/project/run` or `--resume wandb/project/run --epochs 350`, with pseudocode:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> if type(resume) is str and resume.startswith('wandb/'):\r\n>    _, project, run = resume.split('/')\r\n>    run_id = find_runid_from_run(run, assert_unique_run=True)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\n@glenn-jocher All of this is done.

Currently no model checkpoints are being saved as artifacts if you don't set `--save_period`. By default, it is set as -1. Is it okay or would you prefer to automatically log the final artifact by default? I was thinking of this logic.\r\n```\r\nif opt.save_period == -1:\r\n    opt.save_period == opt.epochs\r\n```\r\nLet me know what you think. Also, I'll clean up a few things from `utils/wandb_logging` folder but other things are in place. Can you please review train.py and test.py and let me know  if everything looks good. Let's decide a timeline to push this integration and publicize it.\nSIDE NOTE: \r\nI opened the code on vscode on a smaller device and I don't know why but the editor added new lines at weird places and removed spaces from around operators( like ` = ` became `=` ). That's why github shows more differences in the code than there actually are. I've mostly added code in the folder `wandb_logging`. The changes in train and test scripts are mostly re-arrangements\r\nI've reverted most of the line breaks to as they were but feel free to reformat it using whatever tool you use. Btw do you use black or autopep8 for linting?\n@AyushExel actually I have a super easy linting method, you can do this too. I'd say this is really a must for anyone sharing code. \r\n\r\nI use PyCharm, and they provide an easy PEP8 reformat command here. You can apply on a single file, or to your whole project:\r\n<img width=\"1000\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-03-02 at 12 12 58 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/109710178-357f4500-7b52-11eb-9a38-d1b366021e1a.png\">\r\n\r\n\n@glenn-jocher  Thanks.  I just reformatted using pycharm's PEP8 linter. Now, this PR is all clear from my end. Can you start reviewing this?\r\n\r\nAlso, I wanted to make sure you saw this:\r\n> @glenn-jocher Well, ultimately the checkpoint saving is an opt-in feature. The module won't upload any checkpoint if you don't explicitly ask it to. The artifacts feature is meant to be used in a way that fits your need:\r\n> \r\n> * You can save checkpoints at every epoch if you're on a preemptible resource and then delete( if you want) all the checkpoints except the last one the training is done.\r\n> * Or save only the last checkpoint\r\n> * Or don't save any checkpoint at all( default behavior - which I'm willing to modify after getting your opinion)\r\n> \r\n> The reasoning behind this is that it definitely adds a lot of value to enterprise users of the repo( with cloud resources ). People working on self-driving systems, or medical imaging definitely need a built-in fault-tolerant system that saves all their progress ( if they want to) in case something goes wrong during the training\r\n> \r\n> EDIT: I think I didn't explain it well. setting `opt.save_period = opt.epochs` will not log model for every epoch. It will log only for the last epoch. The logging logic is something like this:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> if curret_epoch % opt.save_period == 0 and (not nosave):\r\n>     log_model_as_artifact()\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> If a user wants to save a model for every epoch, they'll have to explicitly set the --save_period to 1.\r\n> \r\n> Also, if a user is setting the checkpoint period to a larger value, say 50, the model will be logged after every 50 epochs. So, if the run crashes at, say 170th epoch, the user will still be able to resume their runs from the 150th epoch by using the same logic.( `python train.py --resume wandb-artifact://{run_path}`) .\nHey @glenn-jocher sorry to bug you on a weekend. I just removed all the unnecessary changes from `train.py` and now its changelog says `70 deletions and 69 additions` :smile: \r\nAll the other changes are introduced in the `wandb_logging` folder which you don't have to worry about maintaining. \r\n\r\nIf you have some time today, please review the `train.py` file once so that we can get it merged as solving merge conflicts manually every week is too tiring :sweat_smile: \n@AyushExel hey I forgot to ask you, did you find anything related to passing a dictionary via the argparser?\r\n\r\nAlso I see one of the CI tests is failing (ubuntu). That's frustrating, I suspect it's just a failed test for no reason. I will force a re-run of the tests. \r\n\r\nI did some investigating earlier about repeating failed CI tests, but didn't manage to implement anything. The coolest implementation i saw was a simple or statement, i.e. `success = tests | tests`, which runs tests a second time if the first time returns a non-zero exit code (i.e. a failure). \n@glenn-jocher  I've done everything from my end. Also, I've compiled a list of 6 use cases. Here  are all the 7 executable tests.\r\nLet me know if you need anything else from me.\r\n## [Tests Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aXw0tsLKwEtV31UNOrquovnyo05lbtdx?usp=sharing)",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comments indicate a need for several implementation changes and clarifications regarding the resuming of training runs and checkpoint management.

Modify the dataset loading mechanism to check for the existence of `coco128.yaml` before resorting to `coco128_wandb.yaml` using `Path('coco128_wandb.yaml').isfile()`.\n2. Introduce a `--upload-dataset` flag in `train.py` to eliminate reliance on `log_datasets.py`.\n3. Remove the `--log-imgs` option, defaulting to a hardcoded value of 16.\n4.

Implementing additional checks, such as verifying if `opt.data` exists before loading, is recommended to enhance robustness.

    "summarized_comments": "The PR raises several critical issues regarding the implementation of CI testing and file management. Firstly, the renaming of `test.py` to facilitate evaluation purposes is confusing, as it conflicts with its association with pytest/unittests. It is recommended to keep `test.py` unchanged and position `coco128` alongside `yolov5` without altering dataset paths, as the repo's convention is to maintain datasets externally.\n\nThere are also specific constraints on `numpy` versions for `pycocotools`, which necessitates keeping the current requirements, even if tests are passing. Significant changes to filenames and broader modifications across the repository should be avoided to prevent breaking existing workflows. The suggestion is to limit the PR to the addition of the `.github/workflows/ci-testing.yml` file only. Additionally, it would be beneficial to run tests across multiple OS environments and to update the OS specification to `ubuntu-latest`.

For some reason, we need to use it like that:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef attempt_load(weights, map_location=None, inplace=True):    \r\n    with yolov5_in_syspath():        \r\n        from models.yolo import Detect, Model\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we actually need to import `from models.yolo import Detect, Model` not `from yolov5.models.yolo import Detect, Model` and that it is slightly worrying.  \n@SkalskiP I looked through this a bit. detect.py fails because our example images directory was deleted:\r\n`Exception: ERROR: /Users/glennjocher/PycharmProjects/yolov5/yolov5/data/images does not exist`\r\n<img width=\"1247\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-28 at 15 57 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/119995004-73fb9300-bfcd-11eb-8d5a-eba6f0c53d76.png\">\r\n\r\nDo you know of a way to revert the two deleted files? If not we may need to start a new PR, otherwise the git package will store the newly added files separately than the deleted ones, growing our git download size which we don't want.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Once I replace the deleted images detect.py works again:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"969\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-28 at 16 00 43\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/119995489-ec625400-bfcd-11eb-86c7-f669cdf2f3c1.png\">\r\n\r\nEDIT2: I see bus.jpg is pretty large, 473kb, I wonder if we might want to pass it through tinyjpg. Inference results may be slightly worsened, but the filesize would reduce significantly. Unfortunately the git package would only grow though as mentioned before... but the pip package would be reduced right?\n@SkalskiP if I comment out the `with` statement and change imports to:\r\n`    from yolov5.models.yolo import Detect, Model`\r\n\r\nI don't get a serialization error, I get a model difference error:\r\n`AttributeError: 'Detect' object has no attribute 'inplace'`\r\n\r\nThis is due to the PR Detect and Model modules having different `type`s than the v5.0 release checkpoints in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases/tag/v5.0\r\n\r\nOne option for fixing this would be load and re-save all official v5.0 models in a new v5.1 release. detect.py has this checkpoint update capability with the --update flag:\r\n```\r\npython detect.py --update\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/ba6f3f974bfc4a2968964dbe5eedea73c9f5efcb/detect.py#L179-L182\n@SkalskiP I've cleaned up the PR a bit, removed some un-needed changes, and applied a few fixes. Everything seems to work correctly now with the sys path fix being required in only one location (attempt_load() in experimental.py).\r\n\r\nI tested train, test, detect, hubconf, all work. It looks like we have significant conflicts built-up over the week of master updates though, and we need to figure out how best to revert the data/images directory deletion if possible.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Perhaps rather than fix the conflicts would it make more sense to start a new PR with the same changes, retaining the data/images directory?\n@SkalskiP you can update requirments.txt as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nscikit-learn>=0.24; python_version>=\"3.9\"\r\nscikit-learn>=0.19.2; python_version<\"3.9\"\r\n```\n@SkalskiP @fcakyon one major problem I see here is that users will be running commands from two locations: the root directory 'yolov5' and the 'yolov5/yolov5' directory. \r\n\r\nAll of the current paths are setup assuming commands run from yolov5/yolov5, but the new import structure does not support that, so I think we need to add yolov5/ to the sys path on the executable files, i.e. train.py, test.py, detect.py, yolo.py, export.py like this:\r\n\r\nFor files in yolov5/yolov5 to add yolov5/ to sys.path:\r\n```\r\nFILE = Path(__file__).absolute()\r\nsys.path.append(str(FILE.parents[1]))  # add /yolov5 to sys.path\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor files in yolov5/yolov5/models to add yolov5/ to sys.path:\r\n```\r\nFILE = Path(__file__).absolute()\r\nsys.path.append(str(FILE.parents[2]))  # add /yolov5 to sys.path\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tested this out and it allows me to execute these files from anywhere in the directory structure, though a few extra updates are necessary, i.e. to absolutely fix the logging directory here rather than making it relative to the execution dir:\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/ba6f3f974bfc4a2968964dbe5eedea73c9f5efcb/train.py#L479\r\n\r\nEDIT: Implemented this update for all 5 files in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/3357/commits/9c1789d891db64d0c45db7b55a96973dc16b7b09\n@glenn-jocher adding directories to system path is not a good practice in general, it may create interferences with previously installed packages.\r\n\r\nbetter solution for running commands would be utilizing the `entry_points` parameter of the `setup.py`:\r\n```python\r\nentry_points={\r\n    'console_scripts': [\r\n        'train=yolov5.train:main',\r\n        'test=yolov5.test:main',\r\n        'detect=yolov5.detect:main',\r\n        'export=yolov5.models.export:main'\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\n```\n@fcakyon actually yes we could use some help here. I just created an `is_pip()` function to allow us to respond differently depending on whether users are running commands on git clones or pip package versions of the repo. I'm not sure what the best solution is, but we definitely want to allow users to execute the 5 main functions from anywhere in the directory structure, otherwise there will be a lot of confused users and bug reports. We need both of these to work with the code and be compatible with pip usage:\r\n\r\n## Run from `yolov5/`\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\ncd yolov5\r\npython yolov5/detect.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Run from `yolov5/yolov5/`\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\ncd yolov5/yolov5\r\npython detect.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n@glenn-jocher  I'm with @fcakyon on this one. Using `sys.path.append` is a hack and it is not correct practice. We only need to do it in one place when we deserialize models.\r\n\r\n> All of the current paths are setup assuming commands run from yolov5/yolov5, but the new import structure does not support that\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by **does not support that**?\n@fcakyon I did update dependencies. The package will now have support for python `3.6.2-3.9`. \n@glenn-jocher and @fcakyon  my opinion is:\r\n\r\n1. That we should not suggest users to install our project using `requirements.txt`. They should use `setup.py`. If they'll use pip package then great they use `setup.py` by default. If they clone repo they should do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5\r\npip install -e .\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. I added script entry points suggested by @fcakyon. But even without them, there should not be a problem with running them both from `yolov5` and `yolov5/yolov5`. There are ways to do it without `sys.path.append`, which - in my opinion - is unacceptable. Right now users can do it like that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# from yolov5\r\npython -m yolov5.detect --source yolov5/data/images/bus.jpg\r\n\r\n# from yolov5/yolov5\r\npython -m detect --source data/images/bus.jpg\r\n\r\n# from yolov5\r\nyolov5_detect --source yolov5/data/images/bus.jpg\r\n\r\n# from yolov5/yolov5\r\nyolov5_detect --source data/images/bus.jpg\r\n\r\n# from yolov5\r\npython yolov5/detect.py --source yolov5/data/images/bus.jpg\r\n\r\n# from yolov5/yolov5\r\npython detect.py --source data/images/bus.jpg\r\n```\r\n\r\n`pip install -e .` does much more than just install dependencies. For example, it does all sys operation for you.\n@glenn-jocher I cleaned up and removed those `sys.path.append` as well as `is_pip` function. All in all, we have support for `3.6.2-3.9` and we can run our script from multiple locations. \n@SkalskiP I see what you say in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/3357#issuecomment-850847703, but in the real world users are going to do what they like, not what we tell them, so they will `pip install -r requirements.txt` as they've always done and then proceed directly to trying to run detect.py etc., which will shortly be followed by them raising a bug report when they see errors they don't understand, and then I'll have to spend my time explaining these **breaking changes** one by one to everyone:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1417\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-05-29 at 20 52 43\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/120081882-0ed49a00-c0c0-11eb-83f3-d9942f8cdfb8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\n1. I merged `develop` into `feature/restructuring_yolov5_codebase_to_prepare_for_pip_package_creation` so we are up to date with changes\r\n2. @glenn-jocher I realize that you are the creator of this repository and can only advise you.  But my opinion is as follows:\r\n- Remove `requirements.txt` from the repository and stick to `setup.py`. `requirements.txt` is redundant and will create confusion. (no `requirements.txt` -> no `pip install -r requirements.txt`)\r\n- Update `README.md` with proper instructions. \r\n- Stay away from `sys.path.append` if it's not necessary. (serialization - necessary; people do not know how to use python - not necessary)",
    "sumarized_length": 1113,
    "summarized_comments": "In this PR discussion, multiple technical concerns and suggestions were raised. Key points include issues with model deserialization between old and new directory structures, leading to serialization errors when running commands from different locations. There was a need to modify import paths from `from yolov5.models.yolo import Detect, Model` to use the context manager `yolov5_in_syspath`, indicating a problematic dependency on the new structure.\n\nThe use of `sys.path.append` was heavily criticized as a poor practice, with calls for improved handling of command execution from varied directory levels. A suggestion to leverage the `entry_points` parameter in `setup.py` was supported to simplify command execution without relying on path manipulation.\n\nAdditionally, it was proposed to eliminate `requirements.txt`, clarifying installation methods in the README, and maintaining compatibility across Python versions (3.6.2-3.9), highlighting the need for clearer user guidance and reduced confusion. The team emphasized the importance of avoiding breaking changes that lead to user errors and bug reports."

    "unsumarized_comments": "@glenn-jocher  Ah, I didn't realize that issue was related because of the title but they definitely have overlap here. Agreed on the ease of multiple hyp files for different datasets. I think it's ok to leave the included hyps in `train.py` as a default, but they could also be moved and have the argparser default to a 'default_hyp.yaml` or 'coco_hyp.yaml` file, as you suggest. \r\n\r\nI noticed and adjusted some of those plots/images as well. I'll add some commits changing the save location of the rest. I'm tentatively using the argument `save_dir ='.'` for the plotting functions in `utils.py`. In `train.py`, `save_dir = log_dir`, when applicable. \r\n\r\nI like the idea of moving those to tensorboard or another dashboard. You've already done a great job making all of the other losses/metrics available there, so adding these there as well makes sense. \r\n\r\nAlso, the `--resume-from-run` argument is designed to address the use case in #20 . You can specify a particular task to resume from, in case more than one was interrupted. I'm not sure this is as clear as it could be, so I'm interested in any suggestions you may have on that. \n@alexstoken ah, interesting. In your case it seems like resume actually improved your mAP (!). Is this because you trained to 900, then resumed to 1000 then resumed to 2000? Then it has been applied a bit like a cos cycle LR scheduler. I think  you'd probably get a similar mAP training from the beginning to 2000 in one go however. If not then there's something else odd happening which I don't understand. I've seen others claiming that yolov3 resuming helped their mAP as well, but I usually attribute these to people training too few epochs initially.\r\n\r\nBTW, one fix here is that the F1 label should now read mAP@0.5:0.95, we no longer output F1 anywhere.\r\n\r\nOther changes look good!\n@glenn-jocher  I originally had this logic, which requires two args (`--resume` and `--resume-from-run`) but does take into account a user forgetting to set either one: \r\n```\r\n    # logic to resume from latest run if either --resume or --resume-from-run is selected\r\n    # Note if neither --resume or --resume-from-run, last is set to empty string\r\n    if opt.resume_from_run:\r\n        opt.resume = True\r\n        last = opt.resume_from_run\r\n    elif opt.resume and not opt.resume_from_run:\r\n        last = get_latest_run()\r\n        print(f'WARNING: No run provided to resume from. Resuming from most recent run found at {last}')\r\n    else:\r\n        last = ''\r\n\r\n    # if resuming, check for hyp file\r\n    if last:\r\n        last_hyp = last.replace('last.pt', 'hyp.yaml')\r\n        if os.path.exists(last_hyp):\r\n            opt.hyp = last_hyp\r\n\r\n    opt.weights = last if opt.resume else opt.weights\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe an alternative would be to have `--resume`  take a string instead of `store_true`, and if it's an empty string, then `get_latest_run()` is called? That would result in similar behavior but still with one arg. \r\n\r\nEDIT: As Lightning has it, they call the arg `--resume-from-checkpoint`, see [here](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/trainer.html#resume-from-checkpoint).\n@alexstoken ok I have an idea. I ran a few experiments and found we could use one argument like this. Here is an example file argparse_test.py:\r\n```python\r\nimport argparse\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\r\n    parser.add_argument('--epochs', type=int, default=300)\r\n    parser.add_argument('--resume', nargs='?', default=False, help='resume training from last.pt')\r\n\r\n    opt = parser.parse_args()\r\n    print(opt)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a hack, but we can allow all resume functionality with the one command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ python argparse_test.py\r\nNamespace(epochs=300, resume=False)  # DO NOT RESUME\r\n\r\n$ python argparse_test.py --resume\r\nNamespace(epochs=300, resume=None)  # RESUME FROM LAST RUN\r\n\r\n$ python argparse_test.py --resume runs/abc/ \r\nNamespace(epochs=300, resume='runs/abc/')  # RESUME FROM SPECIFIED RUN\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\n@glenn-jocher I think that almost works. The issue I found is that python treats `None` and `False` the same in conditionals. However, argparse does have a solution with the `nargs=?` that you found, combined with both `default` and `const` set in `add_argument`. \r\n\r\nHere is my proposed `argparser_test.py`:\r\n```python\r\nimport argparse\r\n\r\ndef get_last():\r\n    return 'new_last.pt'\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\r\n    parser.add_argument('--epochs', type=int, default=300)\r\n    parser.add_argument('--resume', nargs='?', const = 'get_last', default=False, help='resume training from last.pt')\r\n    parser.add_argument('--weights', type=str, default='', help='initial weights path')\r\n    \r\n    opt = parser.parse_args()\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    last = get_last() if opt.resume == 'get_last' else opt.resume\r\n    if last and not opt.weights:\r\n        print(f'Resuming training from {last}')\r\n    opt.weights = last if opt.resume and not opt.weights else opt.weights\r\n\r\n    print('Last: ',last)\r\n    print('opt.weights: ', opt.weights)\r\n    print(opt)\r\n```\r\nThis results in \r\n```bash\r\n$ python .\\argparse_test.py\r\nLast:  False\r\nopt.weights:\r\nNamespace(epochs=300, resume=False, weights='')\r\n\r\n$ python .\\argparse_test.py --resume\r\nResuming training from new_last.pt\r\nLast:  new_last.pt\r\nopt.weights:  new_last.pt\r\nNamespace(epochs=300, resume='get_last', weights='new_last.pt')\r\n\r\n$ python .\\argparse_test.py --resume path/to/test.pt\r\nResuming training from path/to/test.pt\r\nLast:  path/to/test.pt\r\nopt.weights:  path/to/test.pt\r\nNamespace(epochs=300, resume='path/to/test.pt', weights='path/to/test.pt')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll test this again in `train.py` and commit it if it works. \nThanks for the contribution. There may be a mistake to log the parameters in \"hyp\" as the parameters in \"hyp\" are modified some times. For example, currently  we log \"hyp['cls'] *=nc/80\" rather than the original  hyp['cls']. I would suggest that we move the following lines\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Save run settings\r\n    with open(Path(log_dir) / 'hyp.yaml', 'w') as f:\r\n        yaml.dump(hyp, f, sort_keys=False)\r\n    with open(Path(log_dir) / 'opt.yaml', 'w') as f:\r\n        yaml.dump(vars(opt), f, sort_keys=False)\r\n````\r\nto line 54 in \"train.py\"\r\n\n@glenn-jocher  Glad to see it's all working well. Sorry to not have picked up on your formatting when I went through it the first time around. Probably would have been an easier merge if I had. \r\n\r\n@jundengdeng good catch! I had it down there specifically to log the updated `hyp['cls']`, but you're right, if it logs that and then you rerun with `--resume`, becuase of the `*=` you'll get a different result. It seems a similar scaling happens to weight decay. @glenn-jocher , this raises a question: do you want to log the final hyperparameters used with the model (as is currently done), or do we want to log the hyperparameters that would properly be sent for a `--resume` run to be consistent? \r\n\r\nI had done the former on purpose for logging because it shows the user what the model actually ran with, but it does create a bug with the `--resume` functionality. But now that I look closer, it seems that because the adjustments are just scaling, so the true \"effective\" hyp values that should be preserved are the ones originally passed in. Is this correct?\n@alexstoken @jundengdeng we want to log the settings to reproduce a run, so we should ignore the operations that those settings undergo once inside a run, as it is the responsibility of train.py to resume properly given the same initial settings and an epoch number.\r\n\r\nThis particular operation scales class loss by count, otherwise the loss mean operation will have negative effects for smaller class count datasets as the cls hyp was set for COCO at 80 classes.\r\n\r\nNo worries about the formatting, I should probably probably make a contribution guide or similar. One of the simplest things you can do is to pass your code through a PEP8 formatter prior to submission. PyCharm makes this very easy for example with Code > Reformat Code.\nI've updated the log_dir naming defaults now to make it a bit cleaner in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/commit/603ea0bfdc9b0db3b367fbe7cac5ba6f9a50a49f\r\n\r\nNew runs will be saved to runs/exp1, runs/exp2 etc with optional --name, i.e. runs/exp3_name\n@alexstoken @jundengdeng do you guys have any thoughts on integrating hyps dictionaries into data.yaml files?\r\n\r\nI've been considering how to extract the hyps from train.py, since I think they should absolutely be seperated, but I'm not sure whether to place the hyps in their own yaml file, as in yolov5/hyps/hyps_coco.yaml etc, or to simply place them directly into the coco.yaml file.\r\n\r\nI suppose hyps may vary optimally between models, i.e. yolov5s and yolov5x are very different sizes, its possible each may have optimal and different hyps from each other, but the main differentiator is the dataset in my mind, so it would be reasonable to link a hyps dictionary to a dataset. What do you think?\n> @alexstoken @jundengdeng do you guys have any thoughts on integrating hyps dictionaries into data.yaml files?\r\n> \r\n> I've been considering how to extract the hyps from train.py, since I think they should absolutely be seperated, but I'm not sure whether to place the hyps in their own yaml file, as in yolov5/hyps/hyps_coco.yaml etc, or to simply place them directly into the coco.yaml file.\r\n> \r\n> I suppose hyps may vary optimally between models, i.e. yolov5s and yolov5x are very different sizes, its possible each may have optimal and different hyps from each other, but the main differentiator is the dataset in my mind, so it would be reasonable to link a hyps dictionary to a dataset.

    "sumarized_length": 1062,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR discussion highlights several concrete technical issues and implementation concerns. First, there is a proposal to enhance the argument parser in `train.py` by allowing `--resume` to accept either a specific path or a boolean value, thus simplifying the interface. The idea of defaulting the hyperparameter file path to unique YAML files like `default_hyp.yaml` is endorsed, while the potential move to TensorBoard for metrics visualization is encouraged. \n\nAdditionally, there's a concern regarding the logging of hyperparameters post-training, where the current approach might log modified values instead of original settings, raising issues for users resuming training. It's recommended to separate hyperparameters from runtime operations to facilitate accurate resuming. The contributors debated integrating hyperparameter dictionaries into data YAML files, suggesting that a linked structure based on datasets could optimize parameter management across models. The proposed changes to `log_dir` structure also aim for better clarity and organization."

This is present in your PR on L23 of wandb_logging.\r\n- The device selection in the PR need to conform to the user requested device, i.e. if --device cpu is passed for training, your device selection line will not currently respect that.\r\n- Can we rename wandb_logging/ to wandb/ ?\r\n- The dataloader arguments can largely all be eliminated if all we need is the image paths. See my autoanchor implementation for an example of a minimal dataloader call (EDIT: dataloader seems unnecessary, _dataset_ should suffice as in autoanchor example):\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/d9212140b355b84e85a473be590720eb8221766c/utils/autoanchor.py#L103\r\n\r\nI haven't reviewed the second file yet, but can you please address the above points and let me know, and then I will review again? Thanks!\r\n\n@glenn-jocher I addressed these points:\r\n*  Replaced dataloader with LoadImagesAndLabels, eliminating most of the dataloader arguments \r\n*  Using `Path() / 'name'` instead of str + str (WANDB_PREFIX is still str though)\r\n* Not using check_dataset\r\n* Eliminated --device, as we're just logging stuff and not using any GPU intensive tasks\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n* The import order here might seem a bit out of place, but importing `WandbLogger` ensures that `utils` is added to the system path which eliminates the need for relative imports.\r\n```\r\nfrom wandb_utils import WandbLogger\r\nfrom utils.datasets import create_dataloader, LoadImagesAndLabels\r\n```\r\n* haven't replaced 'wandb_logging' folder name 'wandb' as it causes problems while importing wandb.\r\n* As I do most of this development on GCP VM, I can't check for PEP8 compatibility.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I missed something\r\n\n> @glenn-jocher I addressed these points:\r\n> \r\n> * Replaced dataloader with LoadImagesAndLabels, eliminating most of the dataloader arguments\r\n> * Using `Path() / 'name'` instead of str + str (WANDB_PREFIX is still str though)\r\n> * Not using check_dataset\r\n> * Eliminated --device, as we're just logging stuff and not using any GPU intensive tasks\r\n> \r\n> Note:\r\n> \r\n> * The import order here might seem a bit out of place, but importing `WandbLogger` ensures that `utils` is added to the system path which eliminates the need for relative imports.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> from wandb_utils import WandbLogger\r\n> from utils.datasets import create_dataloader, LoadImagesAndLabels\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> * haven't replaced 'wandb_logging' folder name 'wandb' as it causes problems while importing wandb.\r\n> * As I do most of this development on GCP VM, I can't check for PEP8 compatibility.\r\n> \r\n> Let me know if I missed something\r\n\r\nThanks, will review again today!\n@AyushExel ok I've reviewed and updated a bit, and commented some areas that seemed to benefit from updates but wanted you to review first. \r\n\r\nOne important note is that we have a `python train.py --nosave` options, which only saves last.pt (and copies it as best.pt) on final epoch. Will the new code play well with this?\n@glenn-jocher  I cannot see these awesome reviews on my end. Anyway thanks for pointing these out. I've addressed the following.\r\n* **L119 is redundant. Removed it**\r\n* **L102 - L109 seems redundant. Removed it** I was actually planning something around this in the lines of \"deployment\".  I thought of having a separate artifact called \"final_models\" with only the final models for each experiment for easier deployment of yolov5 models directly from the terminal. Right now it seems a bit far fetched. But let me know if you have any plans to support deployment in the future. I've gotten rid of it for now.\r\n* **Using single line assert statements replacing the 3-line value error checks**\r\n* **L120- matrix values are assigned to a tuple. This works fine** I'm extracting the matrix values in the code later on.\r\n* **redundant `import os`. Removed it** . Now using the relative imports as you suggested.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I missed something",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR raised several important points that need addressing. A test failed without clear linkage to the proposed changes, leading to a suggestion for automated CI reruns on failure due to potential flakiness in testing. The organization of the file structure was also a concern; the top-level directory should remain uncluttered, prompting a recommendation to consolidate new functionality into `utils/wandb_utils.py` or create a `utils/wandb` directory if more files are needed.\n\nThe reviewer highlighted the use of `SafeLoader` over `FullLoader`, PEP8 conformity, and the redundancy of `check_dataset()` calls. They emphasized using `pathlib.Path()` for file handling to improve OS compatibility, as well as ensuring device selection respects user input. The need to rename `wandb_logging` to `wandb` was noted, but concerns were raised regarding import issues. The PR's recent updates were acknowledged, which addressed many of these points, yet attention was drawn to compatibility with existing command-line options, particularly `--nosave`."

    "unsumarized_comments": "@Ilyabasharov \r\n\r\nI am currently training the model with mentioned hyper parameter, but I am not able to run on the batch size that was mentioned due to GPU Ram constraint. \n@aash1999 hi,\n\nThank you for reaching out. I understand that you are experiencing GPU RAM constraints while trying to run the model with the mentioned batch size. GPU RAM limitations can indeed be a challenge.\n\nTo address this issue, you can try the following potential solutions:\n\n1. Reduce the batch size: You can decrease the batch size until it fits within the available GPU RAM. However, please keep in mind that reducing the batch size may affect training performance.\n\n2. Utilize gradient accumulation: Instead of updating the model weights after every batch, you can accumulate gradients over multiple batches before performing a weight update. This allows you to effectively simulate a larger batch size without exceeding the GPU RAM limit.\n\n3. Utilize mixed precision training: By using mixed precision training, you can take advantage of GPU tensor cores and reduce the memory requirement. Tools like Nvidia's Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) can help streamline this process.\n\nPlease note that these are general suggestions, and the optimal solution may vary depending on your specific use case and the resources available to you.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please let me know.\n\nThank you!\nHi @glenn-jocher, @Ilyabasharov \r\n\r\nI ran the model on an A100 for 300 epochs as mentioned in the paper with the same hyperparameters, but only with a batch size of 70. I obtained the following results:\r\n\r\nHIC-YOLOv5 (test): 35.16 mAP@0.5, 20.23 mAP@[0.5:0.95]\r\nHIC-YOLOv5 (Val): 44.02 mAP@0.5, 25.82 mAP@[0.5:0.95]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, YOLOv5 (test) achieved 27.57 mAP@0.5 and 14.43 mAP@[0.5:0.95] on the VISDRONE dataset.\r\n\r\nThanks\n@aash1999 hi,\r\n\r\nThank you for providing a comprehensive overview of the code changes you made in this PR. I appreciate the effort you put into integrating the CBAM and Involution modules into the YOLOv5 model.\n\nI have carefully reviewed your changes, and they seem well-documented and aligned with the goals of enhancing the model's performance. I also took a look at the performance metrics you shared in the linked comment, and the results look promising.\n\nThe modifications you made in `models/common.py` and `model/yolo.py` to integrate the CBAM and Involution modules, as well as the addition of the two configuration files, appear to be well thought out and essential for implementing the architecture described in the paper.\n\nI see that you also addressed an issue related to backward implementation during GPU training in `utils/general.py` by including the code `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(False, warn only=True)`. If there are any alternative solutions to tackle this problem, it would be beneficial to explore them.\n\nOverall, I think your changes align with our project's objectives and will enhance the performance of YOLOv5. However, before merging, I would appreciate it if you could address any open issues and ensure that all tests and checks pass successfully.\n\nThank you for your contribution. Keep up the great work!\n\nBest,\n@glenn-jocher \r\nThank you for your efforts in reviewing. I am encountering an issue with the checks. Even though it passes all the tests, there is one in the pre-commit:\r\n```\r\nfix end of files.........................................................Passed\r\ntrim trailing whitespace.................................................Failed\r\n- hook id: trailing-whitespace\r\n- exit code: 1\r\n- files were modified by this hook\r\n\r\nFixing utils/general.py\r\n\r\ncheck for case conflicts.................................................Passed\r\ncheck docstring is first.................................................Passed\r\nfix double quoted strings................................................Passed\r\ndetect private key.......................................................Passed\r\nUpgrade code.............................................................Passed\r\nSort imports.............................................................Passed\r\nYAPF formatting..........................................................Failed\r\n- hook id: yapf\r\n- files were modified by this hook\r\nMD formatting............................................................Passed\r\nPEP8.....................................................................Passed\r\ncodespell................................................................Passed\r\n```\r\nit will be helpful if you guide me on how o fix it .\n@aash1999 the issue you're encountering with the checks is related to the \"trailing-whitespace\" and \"yapf\" hooks. Based on the output you provided, it seems that the pre-commit hook is failing because there are trailing whitespaces and the yapf formatter has made modifications to files.\n\nTo fix the trailing whitespace issue, you can open the \"utils/general.py\" file and remove any extra spaces or tabs at the end of a line. It's important to ensure that there are no trailing whitespaces in the file.\n\nFor the yapf formatter issue, you can run the yapf formatter on the modified files to make sure they comply with the yapf formatting style. You can use the command `yapf -i file.py` to apply the yapf formatting.\n\nAfter making these changes, you can rerun the checks and pre-commit hook to ensure that all tests pass successfully.\n\nI hope this guidance helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any other questions.\n\n\n\r\n> * Ensure that the hyperparameters in `hyp.hic-yolov5s.yaml` are correctly set for your specific dataset.\r\n\r\nHello @glenn-jocher, \r\nhow exactly, a one can set the hyperparameters correctly to a specific dataset ? (in my case, fire detection)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\nHello @raoufslv,\n\nGreat question! To tailor the hyperparameters for your specific dataset, such as fire detection, you can start by training with the default settings to establish a baseline. From there, you can adjust the hyperparameters based on your dataset's characteristics.\n\nFor example:\n- **Learning Rate:** Adjust if the model is not converging or is overfitting.\n- **Batch Size:** Use the largest batch size your hardware can handle.\n- **Augmentation Parameters:** Increase augmentation to improve generalization, especially if your dataset is small.\n\nYou can also use the Hyperparameter Evolution feature in YOLOv5 to automatically find the best hyperparameters for your dataset. For more details, refer to the [Hyperparameter Evolution Tutorial](https://docs.ultralytics.com/guides/model-training-tips//).\n\nGood luck with your fire detection project! 🔥",

It downloads from the Nvidia developer program. So you first need to register a Nvidia account and then search for `TensorRT` in the Nvidia download center. Following the instructions to download the `*.tar.gz` file. Uncompress it, the `tensorrt` package is under the python folder. Then you also need set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the `<tensorrt_dir>/lib64`. I don't sure the CUDA and cuDNN library is required or not. I will do some experience on colab and fell back to you later.\n@imyhxy thanks! I got the notebook working, but detect.py inference is very slow with yolov5s.engine (270ms). I think perhaps it's running on CPU? Is that possible?

The TensorRT is a NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU deploy library which requires a NVIDIA GPU to run.\r\n\r\n2. I see there are some version mismatched warning in your screenshot, so maybe that is the reason for slow inference. The TensorRT has a bunches of preset tactics which aim to perform different operations (Conv, Linear...) on different GPU architecture (Pascal, Tunning, Amper...). When building the TensorRT plan file, it benchmarks each operation of the network with their support tactics, and choose the one best for inference speed. The A100 is a GPU with Amper architecture, and the V100 is Tunning architecture. So the cuDNN library (one of the tactic source for TensorRT) maybe too old to have the optimized tactics for Amper architecture (not confirmed yet). I will update the shared colab to install newest cuDNN library today.\r\n\r\n3. The TensorRT plan file is designed to run on the same machine who generates it. If someone want to use the plan file on other machine, at least make sure the GPU and version of CUDA, cuDNN is the same (there are other affect factors: CPU, memory...)\r\n\r\n4. It's totally cool to read ONNX file from disk, the reason I don't do that just want to make the exporting of ONNX and TensorRT independent, and a little faster saving and loading speed.\r\n\r\n5. The `build_engine` and `build_serialized_network` is not equal, the `build_serialized_network` return a memory block that holding a serialized engine, so it can't be call the `serialize()` method. And I don't use new API because I was not confirmed it works on TensorRT 7 or not. I will check it today and fell back.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** I have checked that the `build_serialized_network` only on TensorRT 8, so I am not sure we should only compatiable to TensorRT 8 or not. If you want to remove the warning, just change `build_engine` to `build_serialized_network` and remove the following `serialize()` call.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Update [script](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1j-PQgm5AzfkayCQGnO_M_CcOPKFIEnsJ?usp=sharing). By the way, I am not sure hosting the TensorRT and cuDNN package is viloating the license or not.\n@glenn-jocher Hi, `--half` can be applied to both `detect.py` and `val.py`, and currently they both respect `--half` option: \r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/e312b0f5ea2cd92a4dd83bf7f38e87a66994b475/detect.py#L84\r\n\r\nAnd the TensorRT plan file do accept and only accept FP16 image when it was exported by `export.py` script with `--half` option. Otherwise the memory won't be align and will raise error by TensorRT runtime. So the export stage and detect/val stage should be consistent with the `--half` option.\r\n\r\nFor the license part, I am not a native English speaker, and make me hard to understand the license document. According to the following section, seem like that we can't just redistribution the original files. FYI, I also attach the license document here. \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n1.2.

I got the notebook working, but detect.py inference is very slow with yolov5s.engine (270ms). I think perhaps it's running on CPU? Is that possible? BTW I hosted the Colab TRT install file here to allow for a public notebook example: https://ultralytics.com/assets/TensorRT-8.2.0.6.Linux.x86_64-gnu.cuda-11.4.cudnn8.2.tar.gz\r\n> \r\n> <img alt=\"Screenshot 2021-11-21 at 17 36 23\" width=\"1605\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/142770797-0662cf66-75b4-4bf9-a643-fbb839a57aef.png\">\r\n> \r\n> **EDIT: Nevermind, I re-ran with a V100 Colab instance and speeds improved to 3 ms. Perhaps this was just an A100 issue.**\r\n@glenn-jocher\r\nHi, your inference time are all right. The reason is that inferencing with engine file, the first image's inference time is very big. And the second image time is normal. You can check the details of your image in the comment. The time of ``bus.jpg`` is 538ms while the ``zidane.jpg`` cost 2ms. And you mentioned about ``269.9ms`` is the average time of the two images' inference time.\r\nBtw, another reason is perhaps, the frequency of GPU is the largest? I run the model on Jetson Nano, and inference time is not stable because the power of Nano is not MAXN and the frequency of GPU is not the maximum. Perhaps this will not happen on GPU server, but I doubt it may be a reason. And anyone run model on Jetson series can pay attention to this point. It's my suggestion.\r\nThank you!\n@wanghr323 Seems you are not set the TensorRT environment properly. Make sure your `<TensorRT>/lib` is include in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.\n@imyhxy  When converting pytorch model to TensorRT engine, the `--half` option mainly effects via two lines below:\r\n1. `im, model = im.half(), model.half()  # to FP16`\r\n2. `config.set_flag(trt.BuilderFlag.FP16)`\r\n\r\nWith line 1, generated TensorRT network will following intput/output binding layers as follows:\r\n\r\n> 0   INPUT     kHALF  images          3x640x640\r\n> 1   OUTPUT kHALF  350             3x80x80x85\r\n> 2   OUTPUT kHALF  418             3x40x40x85\r\n> 3   OUTPUT kHALF  486             3x20x20x85\r\n> 4   OUTPUT kFLOAT output          25200x85\r\n\r\nIf without line 1, the result is:\r\n\r\n> 0   INPUT  kFLOAT images          3x640x640\r\n> 1   OUTPUT kFLOAT 350             3x80x80x85\r\n> 2   OUTPUT kFLOAT 416             3x40x40x85\r\n> 3   OUTPUT kFLOAT 482             3x20x20x85\r\n> 4   OUTPUT kFLOAT output          25200x85\r\n\r\nI noticed `model.half()` and `im.half()` affects onnx exporting, which results in a differenct in layer precision in TensorRT network definition. But after building engine with `FP16` flag,  what's the difference between the generated engine files?\r\n\r\nI don't know what TensorRT exactly do when BuilderFlag is set to FP16.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment addresses multiple technical aspects regarding the integration of TensorRT with the `val.py` script. Key changes include the removal of the `pycuda` dependency, opting for PyTorch's memory management, which enhances inference speed by reducing memory copy operations. However, it's crucial to ensure the TensorRT plans are executed on compatible NVIDIA GPUs, as they are not CPU executable. Performance discrepancies observed with different GPUs (A100 vs. V100) may stem from version mismatches in libraries (CUDA, cuDNN) or from the TensorRT build using architecture-specific optimizations. \n\nActionable suggestions include verifying the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setup, aligning CUDA and cuDNN versions with the targeted GPU architecture, and ensuring the consistency of FP16 settings during model export and inference. Additionally, changing from `build_engine` to `build_serialized_network` is proposed to eliminate version warnings, contingent on using TensorRT 8. Lastly, distribution of TensorRT or cuDNN binaries must adhere to licensing considerations."

Specifically, you're getting an `AttributeError` related to its use of the `model.names` attribute. \n\nIt's worth noting that the current version of the script is designed to work with the latest version of YOLOv5. It's possible that in the older version you're working with, the `model.names` attribute was different or not yet implemented, leading to this error. \n\nTo get a better understanding of what's causing this error specifically, could you provide more information about how you're calling the script and what other changes you made in the older version of YOLOv5, if any? \n\nAlternatively, we highly recommend updating YOLOv5 to the latest version (which includes bug fixes and new features) and using the latest version of the `explainer.py` script to avoid any compatibility issues. Thank you.\n@engrjav \r\nThanks for reporting.\r\n\r\nYou can see [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13izqOOnt1Z9k77sPppgDxFsxqpbnKo5-) demo which is working very well.  \r\nHowever, I have to investigate more for your issue. I think it could be solved by calling `.cpu()` for `image[0]`. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfixed_image = np.array(image[0].cpu()).transpose(1, 2, 0)\r\n```\r\nI will do an analysis about this problem soon. \nHello @pourmand1376,\n\nThank you for raising this issue related to the YOLOv5 explainer on GitHub.\n\nIn regards to your issue, it seems that calling `.cpu()` for `image[0]` could resolve the problem.  You can try something like this:\n\n```\nfixed_image = np.array(image[0].cpu()).transpose(1, 2, 0)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also try using the YOLOv5 explainer on the latest version of YOLOv5 which includes a bug fix for the issue you encountered.\n\nI appreciate your patience as we work to resolve this issue. Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nThanks and Have a great day!\nthank you @glenn-jocher and @pourmand1376 \r\nI dealt with the error by using cpu only instead of cuda.

I'm glad to hear that you were able to resolve the previous issue. \n\nRegarding the new error you are encountering, the warning message you received suggests that division by zero or another invalid value may have occurred. This could happen if the CAM values that you are generating become too small or are NaN. Without more information, it's difficult to say exactly what could be causing this issue. \n\nTo investigate further, I would suggest trying to run the `EigenGradCAM` method with some other images and see if the error persists. Additionally, you could try changing the hyperparameters of the method (such as the threshold or sigma values) to see if that affects the output in any way. \n\nThank you for using YOLOv5 and the explainer, and please let us know if you have any further issues or questions.\n> thank you @glenn-jocher and @pourmand1376 I dealt with the error by using cpu only instead of cuda.

Actually, I haven't tested all of them but it should work just fine. \r\n\r\nIn regard to model types, I have just focused on detection. I think classification and segmentation models would be much easier to adapt. \r\n\r\nThe problem with detection is NMS module which is inherently non-differentiable. I have written a blog post about it [here](https://amirpourmand.ir/posts/2023/yolov5-interpretability-gradcam/) and I explained how I adapted it to YOLO. \r\n\r\nI will add some more pictures for better understanding soon. But I think you will understand what I've done quite easily. \nHi @glenn-jocher and @pourmand1376,  I gone through the code to the link that you shared, its working fine. Many thanks for your input.\r\n\r\nFurther, I have slightly modified the code of @pourmand1376 `explainer.py` from the [link](https://github.com/pourmand1376/yolov5/blob/add_gradcam/explainer/explainer.py) to make it more robust regarding Cam output visualization by taking the idea from this [link](https://jacobgil.github.io/pytorch-gradcam-book/EigenCAM%20for%20YOLO5.html). Mainly the following changes are made: \r\n\r\n- Concerning object detection,  removing heatmap data outside of the bounding boxes and scaling the heatmaps within each box.\r\n- Drawing the bounding boxes for specific class(es) if mentioned via argument otherwise for all classes.\r\n- Showcasing or hiding the class labels. For example, if there is aerial image with large number of objects, then visualizing the labels would resist to analyze the heatmaps optimistically.  Hiding might be preferable in that case. \r\n- Concatenating the images together (original image, cam image, cam image with boxes). \r\n\r\nI am attaching the snapshots below:\r\n\r\n- With single class bus:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/be8f3f28-7047-4137-a088-b3e7ee100042\" height=\"600\" width=\"500\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/ff4a8819-e19d-4489-b7c6-6e83d4c5d341\" height=\"600\" width=\"500\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/71c7f07e-280d-4b5c-a8ef-22914a79b1c9\" height=\"500\">\r\n\r\n- With single class person:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/161f22e0-b674-4410-8fd4-ad19478110fb\" height=\"600\" width=\"500\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/9d115573-5f96-4da0-98bf-52388533b2d1\" height=\"600\" width=\"500\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/2a5d2aff-3734-4baf-92f3-1cac9f0f6630\" height=\"500\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Both classes together\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/7a768879-9642-4767-848b-35336daedb09\" height=\"600\" width=\"500\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/2053cec3-62ab-47d6-bbb3-2afeb6241fed\" height=\"600\" width=\"500\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/assets/67587354/3b422e0d-47ff-45ec-ab44-042937a128dd\" height=\"500\">\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI believe, the changes are significant and beneficial to the YOLOv5 project as a whole, they should be integrated along with the pull request of @pourmand1376.

The same idea actually crossed my mind yesterday, because when I watch the evolution VMs running, sometimes I run the nvidia-smi command, and occasionally a GPU is at 0% utilization. Evolution epochs do not run test.py after each epoch, nor do they save checkpoints, but there is still a period of several seconds of 0% utilization like you said, to reinitialize the dataloader.\r\n\r\nI think this might really help smaller datasets train faster.

That was why I ran it a second time.\r\n\r\n>What do you mean by lower? Slower?\r\n\r\nSorry, by lower, I meant lower training time = faster training speed. I will add a graph to visualize later on.\r\n\r\nFor example, COCO 2017\r\nBase: 2.099 | Inf: 1.989\r\n\r\n> That's actually awesome news, because then perhaps I can run an evolution campaign for COCO finetuning using only 20 epochs results rather than having to evolve hyps on 300 epochs from scratch (which is impractical really for anyone without free cloud access, looking at you google brain team).\r\n\r\nOh yes! You are right. However, the fine tuned version were not able to reach the same height as ones training from scratch, so it should only be used as a guide. I'm thinking of setting one or two GPU to test this theory for a week. Could you give me the evolve commands and the starting hyp? (Should we use the InfiniteDataloader branch?)\r\n\r\n20 epochs would take around 10*20=200 minutes = 3 hours per generation for `5s`. One week could do 40-55 generations. If the first week got some promising results, I may let it run longer.\nFor some visualization, here are a few graphs. Time scale is in minutes. Some runs are averaged.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/91748359-11b26500-ebea-11ea-9e03-308d9310d909.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/91748332-08c19380-ebea-11ea-99b4-fc13d42ccc78.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI did 300 epochs for coco128 to see the gap over long epochs. Single GPU. When batchsize is the whole dataset, it seems to perform poorly in both speed and mAP.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/91748310-fd6e6800-ebe9-11ea-8aeb-fe4fa6f3486f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/91748929-f8f67f00-ebea-11ea-9f3c-501bea8f1bbc.png)\r\n\nHi @glenn-jocher . I saw that you've done 250+ generations already. Cool! (I think we should create a new Issue for this, so there is more visibility and potentially more helpers.)\r\n\r\nI built a simple docker off your `yolov5:evolve` with jupyterlab, so I can visualize it as it evolves. (Here is [link](https://hub.docker.com/r/nanobits/yolov5/tags) for anyone reading + curious and reference)\r\n\r\nI checked that I can `cp`/`ls ` from your bucket. Do I need certain permissions to copy to the bucket? (Not familiar with GCP)\r\n\r\nFine-tuning cannot reach same map as a training from scratch.\r\nI did a comparison for finetuning coco on the `5m` at different batch-size + epochs. \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>5m finetune</summary><br>\r\n\r\nCommand: \r\n```bash\r\npython train.py --data coco.yaml --cfg yolov5m.yaml --weights yolov5m.pt --batch-size $bs --epoch $e\r\n```\r\n\r\nBase mAP is `62.4`.  (From `test.py` normal, not using coco eval map)\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/92010908-8ca78700-ed74-11ea-9d83-110bbac09057.png)\r\n\r\nCloseup at peak:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/92009571-ead36a80-ed72-11ea-9cba-4f9b28d1fe88.png)\r\n\r\nTotal time for each:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/92009954-69300c80-ed73-11ea-8bad-78bfe5b326ab.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nFrom the above, it is safe to say that batchsize **64** with **40** epochs produces the \"best\" results. I'm not sure whether I should re-run it again to confirm this.\r\n\r\nA small test has been done for `5l`. Nothing conclusive can be said. \r\n<details>\r\n<summary>5l finetune</summary><br>\r\n\r\nBase mAP is `65.7`.

We can see how it turns out after a week or two.\r\nIf we go with bs 64 and 40 epochs, it would take around 15h(non-infinite) for one generation. One week would be 11 generations. \r\n\r\n> On a T4, which I'm using, each epoch takes about 1 hour, so we'd get about 4 generations done every 5 days. If I can deploy 8 T4's, this would be about 45 generations per week.\r\n\r\nIs this time for COCO or VOC? If this is COCO, this would be amazing because I could only do 11 generations a week with a single V100 whereas 4T4 could easily do 20? Your setup is really efficient!\r\n\r\n> This works well most of the time, but occasionally I run into simultaneous read/write problems with gsutil, the GCP command line utility that handles all the traffic in and out of the bucket. I'm going to try to deploy a fix for this, and should have everything all set in the next couple days to begin COCO finetuning evolution.\r\n\r\nI will wait for the fix then! Meanwhile, I will set a few runs for a better comparison for the `5l`. \r\n\r\nEdit: I just saw that you use batch-size 40 for 5m. I didn't realize you changed it. Will set finetune test for this.\n@NanoCode012 agree, will open a new issue on this soon.\r\n\r\n--batch 40 is max possible on single 15GB T4 YOLOv5m GCP training with docker image, or --batch 48 with single 16GB V100. I guess you must have used multi-GPU to reach 64.\r\n\r\nIt's possible your finetuning mAPs are higher than you think: test.py runs a slightly more comprehensive (but slightly slower) mAP solution **when called directly i.e. `python test.py`** than when called by train.py, so **testing after training is complete will always result in a slight mAP increase**, perhaps 0.5-1.0% higher. The main differences are 0.5 pad (i.e. 16 pixels), and possibly `multi_label` NMS (this is always `multi_label=True` now, but may be set to `False` during training in the future). pycocotools mAP is unrelated to the above, and will also independently increase mAP slightly.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I just tested a custom dataset and was surprised to see that it finetunes much better with hyp.scratch.yaml than hyp.finetune.yaml. I'm pretty confused by this result. It's possible evolution results on one dataset may not correlate well to a second dataset unfortunately. I'll have to think about it.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1451\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-09-02 at 1 40 17 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/92035466-99e85580-ed23-11ea-8d96-77194df997d7.png\">\r\n\nHi @glenn-jocher ,\r\n\r\n> It's possible your finetuning mAPs are higher than you think: test.py runs a slightly more comprehensive (but slightly slower) mAP solution when called directly i.e. python test.py than when called by train.py, so testing after training is complete will always result in a slight mAP increase, perhaps 0.5-1.0% higher\r\n\r\nI tried to do the below but got the reverse. `test` got a lower mAP.\r\n```bash\r\n# From ReadMe.md\r\npython test.py --data coco.yaml --img 640 --conf 0.001 --weights ...\r\n```\r\nAs an example of my bs64 of 40 epochs coco2017, \r\n| | Tensorboard | test | pycocotools | \r\n|- | - |- | - |\r\n| last |  61.64 | 61.4 (-0.14) | 62.28 (+0.64) |\r\n| best | 62.13 | 61.9 (-0.23) | 62.77 (+0.64) | \r\n\r\nOn coco128 google colab,\r\n\r\n| | train | test | \r\n|- | - |- |\r\n| last |  70.5 | 70.2 |\r\n| best | 70.5 | 70.2 |\r\n\r\n> It's possible evolution results on one dataset may not correlate well to a second dataset unfortunately.

How much did it go up by changing only hyp?

I thought I was evolving some finetuning hyps that would be good for the whole world, but now I'm thinking maybe they're just mainly good for VOC. The final hyps are drastically different than from scratch hyps I started from. lr0 for example drops from 0.01 to 0.003 and momentum dropped from 0.937 to 0.843. This produced about +3 mAP increase in VOC.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that **all models** s/m/l/x appeared to benefit equally from evolving on YOLOv5m, so that's great news on it's own. That means that 5m results at least can be counted on to correlate well with the entire range. I'm going to finetune the 4 from the initial hyps (just once for 50 epochs) also to do a better before and after comparison, because right now I'm just relying on my memory.\r\n\r\nI was looking at sotabench yesterday and decided to try it out, as their existing results seem quite slow to me. It's possible we exceed all of the existing models greatly in terms of mAP at a given speed level. But I found a few bugs in their examples, submitted a PR to their repo, and alltogethor found support very limited there (forum has 10 posts over 2 years), which is unfortunate because the idea seems great.\r\n\r\nMosaic9 didn't fail, it just didn't provide markedly different results than mosaic4 in the VOC tests I ran. I think a key factor in the mosaic is cropping at the image edges, but this is for further exploration. So I suppose that yes, I just need to fix the gsutil overwrite bug and then we can start finetuning COCO. I see your plot there, that's super important, as I'm not sure which hyps to start evolving from. Looks like blue is going to win, but let's wait.\nHi @glenn-jocher , contrary to our expectations, scratch won! Finetune is from gen 306 of VOC.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/92197121-1782a180-ee9b-11ea-9f86-b6714e64d102.png)\r\n\r\n| | Tensorboard | test | pycocotools | \r\n|- | - |- | - |\r\n| scratch |  62.47 | 62.3 (-0.17) | 63.14 (+0.67) |\r\n| finetune | 61.48 | 61.7 (+0.22) | 62.55 (+1.07) | \r\n| |\r\n| prev finetune | 62.13 | 61.9 (-0.22) | 62.77 (+0.64) | \r\n\r\n`python --data coco.yaml --weights ...` (No setting iou)\r\n\r\nThis really made me think whether all my past results could be improved if I had used the scratch hyp or that the current hyp are overfitting to VOC.\r\n\r\n\r\nI see that you've made a bug fix for gs util. I'm thinking of the possibility that two reads and upload and same time, cancelling the other.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of using a Mutex lock styled approach. \r\n\r\n```text\r\nread lock.txt\r\n\r\nwhile lock is in-use\r\n    sleep a few seconds\r\n    read lock.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nset lock to in-use\r\ndo calculation\r\nrelease lock\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is to prevent writing at same time. Theoretically, there would not be a high chance that they will read at the same time between the both of us, but if others were to join in, the chances would be increased..\r\n\r\nThis would be a sure-fire way of blocking albeit expensive, and I don't think this is the norm with blocking in python..\r\n\r\nEdit: Added table.\r\nEdit: I set a few tests with 5m on hyp scratch.\n@NanoCode012 I just finished a set of YOLOv5m 20 epochs finetuning for each hyp file. I get the same results, scratch is better. We can essentially start evolution now, but another idea came to me. I'm thinking the dip in results on epoch 1 may be due to the warmup settings. The warmup slowly ramps up lr and momentum during the first 3 epochs, it is mainly intended for training from scratch to help stability. The intial values for lr and momentum are 0.0 and 0.9 generally, but there is a param group 2 that starts with a very aggressive lr of 0.10, and actually ramps this down to lr0. When training from scratch this helps adjust output biases especially, and works well because bias params are few in number and are not naturally unstable the way weights can be.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking this might be related to the initial drop on finetuning. The effect on final mAP is likely limited, but I'm exploring whether to adjust the warmup when `pretrained=True`.\r\n\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/92286545-3a717d80-eebc-11ea-9926-ca3069084e09.png)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Another option is to make these warmup settings evolve-able, but we already have 23 hyps so I'd rather not grow the group if I don't have to.\nHi @glenn-jocher \r\n\r\n> The new fix should avoid this by ignoring corrupted/empty files, so only a single generation from a single node would be lost rather than the entire file.\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation. \r\n\r\n> Ok, so know to start from hyp.scratch.yaml, we know to use YOLOv5m, now all that's left is to decide a number of epochs and start. I see you used 40 there with good results.\r\n\r\nYep. `hyp scratch`. \r\n\r\nBatchsize test from `hyp finetune` test, 5m for 40 epochs. \r\n(I forgot to mention I'm using a single V100 32 gb and not multi-gpu.)\r\n\r\n| Batch-size | HighestmAP @ epoch | Total time |\r\n|-|-| - |\r\n|32|61.93 @ 21| 15h 30 mn|\r\n|40|61.83 @ 26| 13h 58 mn|\r\n|64| 62.13 @ 25 | 14h 5 mn|\r\n\r\nTime is only for reference. There can be bottlenecks as I train multiple at a time. Would using multiple containers be faster than a single container? I've only done multiple training on a single container at a time, so I can keep track of which commit version I'm on and consolidate the results on Tensorboard. \r\n\r\nYesterday, I've also set tests for different epochs besides 40 such as 20,30,50,60,70,100. The last three are at around epoch 55, so we will see the results by tomorrow as well. This should give us a good grasp on which to choose. We should balance number of epochs with the accuracy. I suspect the longer the epoch, the accuracy becomes marginally better.\r\n\r\n> I am testing a handful of warmup strategies for finetuning with hyp.scratch.yaml now (including no warmup). I should have results by tomorrow.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to these results! \nHi @glenn-jocher , my tests on different epochs are now done.\r\n\r\n**Overview:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/92310087-20778e00-efd5-11ea-9aad-828ad1bf2b18.png)\r\n\r\n**Closer look near peak:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9899957/92310126-85cb7f00-efd5-11ea-875e-fde9dafb4dd9.png)\r\n\r\nAn extra 10 epochs is around 3-4 hours. An epoch is around 19-20 mins.\r\n\r\nResults at highest:\r\n\r\n| Total Epoch | Total time | Highest train mAP @ epoch | \r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| 20 | 7hr 22mn| 62.07 @ 20|\r\n| 30 | 10hr 47mn | 62.35 @ 29|\r\n| 40 | 13h 8mn| 62.47 @ 40|\r\n| 50 | 17h 29mn| 62.49 @ 47 |\r\n| 60 | 20h 58mn| 62.49 @ 55 |\r\n| 70 | 1d 0h 18mn | 62.53 @ 68 |\r\n| 100 | 1d 10h 12mn|  62.62 @ 90 |\r\n\r\nWe should safely be able to use epoch 40 at highest batch-size (64 for me) unless your warmup results proves otherwise. My next concern is how far we are going to tune the hyps (to not overfit) and whether these will have direct correlation to training from scratch as we do not have any conclusive evidence it would happen, only that it reaches near the same value. For ex, pycocotest for finetune_100 reaches **63.32** .\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> I just finished a set of YOLOv5m 20 epochs finetuning for each hyp file. I get the same results, scratch is better.\r\n\r\nDo you also see `test` scores lower than `train` scores? I see them across my entire training.\n@NanoCode012 BTW, about your other question, how finetune hyps will relate to scratch hyps, I really don't know. Evolving finetuning hyps on COCO is probably our most feasible task. We could evolve from-scratch hyps similarly, perhaps for more epochs, i.e. 50 or 100, but these would take much longer to test, since we'd want to apply them to a full 300 epochs, and its possible that scratch hyps evolved for even 100 epochs would overfit far too soon when trained to 300 epochs, so we'd be back to playing the game of preventing early overfitting on our results. This is basically what I did with YOLOv3 last year, it's a very difficult path for those with limited resources. If we were Google we could use a few 8X V100 machines to evolve scratch hyps to 300 full epochs, problem solved, but that door isn't open to us unfortunately, so evolving finetuning for 30 seems like our best bet.\r\n\r\nTo be clear though I don't know how well it will work, it's a big experiment. In ML often you just have to do it and find out.\r\n\r\n\nI plotted just the momentum changes I tried, leaving everything else the same. The results are huge! Lowering initial momentum helps greatly retain some of the initial mAP, and leads to lower validation losses. This makes me think I should test lower initial momentum values as well, maybe 0.2, 0.1, 0.0.\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/92312135-d1990c80-ef72-11ea-8019-71961cf6de84.png)\r\n\r\nThis is initial bias LR, all else equal. Default 0.1 seems too high, 0.0 too low.\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/92312201-73205e00-ef73-11ea-8157-8a67c2975757.png)\r\n\r\nThis is the number of warmup epochs. Well, hmm looking at this one could argue that the best finetuning warmup strategy is no warmup strategy.\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/92312340-939ce800-ef74-11ea-99cb-254984a23850.png)\r\n\r\nCloseup of warmup epochs. The zero warmup trend in the final epochs looks the best, red slop is steepest.\r\n![results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26833433/92312368-ce068500-ef74-11ea-94ff-eddb6aa81f3f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

But the original problem was changing the shape of `anchor_grid` to make the model compatible with opencv. So it makes sense to not modify the definition of  `anchors`.\r\n\r\nLooking at the changes made, I think the current solution is not elegant/ideal. I have another branch locally which fixes the problem and does not modify `anchors`, so no issue with backwards compatibility. I'll add a new commit with this solution after testing with your colab notebook.\r\n\r\nMarking this PR as draft for now.\n@glenn-jocher \r\nAdded new commit with better refactoring.\r\n\r\n**Pros** :\r\n* Lesser changes overall. (+25  -16   ->    +20   -15)\r\n* Kept definition of `anchors` same as before. So no backwards compatibility is needed for it.\r\n* Simple backwards compatibility check for `anchor_grid`. Just checking for type is enough (before `torch.tensor()`, now `list`)\r\n* `anchor_grid` is removed from model's state_dict, so no need to worry about it being overridden during training with --weights option.\r\n\r\nMaster\r\n```\r\nTransferred 362/362 items from yolov5s.pt\r\n```\r\nThis PR\r\n```\r\nTransferred 361/361 items from yolov5s.pt\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Cons**:\r\n* Anchor grid generation requires one additional multiplication during forward(). Don't think it should affect inference speed significantly.\r\n```python\r\nanchor_grid = anchors.clone() * stride\r\n```\r\n---\r\nTested this new commit on Colab GPU. All CI outputs are same as master. Tested export.py with onnx and saved_model, and then detect.py. Same detections as master.\r\n\r\n\n@SamFC10 I fixed this up a bit, but ran into a problem. Since anchor_grid is no longer a `register_buffer` I think it is not getting placed correctly on different devices when users use model.to(device).

    "summarized_comments": "In reviewing the recent PR, several technical issues and implementation considerations were raised. Notably, a RuntimeError was encountered during CI checks, indicating tensors were on mismatched devices (cuda and cpu) due to improper handling of anchors in the model's `train.py`. It was suggested that the loading of pre-trained weights might incorrectly overwrite or reorder anchors, resulting in suboptimal training outcomes. \n\nThe author implemented a new commit to address inaccuracies, retaining backward compatibility by maintaining the original definition of `anchors`. While this improved functionality, it introduced a potential issue where `anchor_grid`, no longer registered as a buffer, might not transfer correctly between devices, leading to inconsistencies during inference. Further tests confirmed similar issues existed in the master branch. \n\nAdditionally, there are concerns that changes simply require an extra multiplication during the forward pass, which should not notably impact inference speed but does raise questions about model architecture flexibility when modifying the backbone. \n\nProposed actions include additional refactoring to ensure components are correctly registered and transferred across devices, alongside re-evaluating workarounds for loading legacy weights."

Both the normal and dynamic models were created with a batch size of 32 (with the dynamic model technically being a *max* batch size of 32). When I say image, I technically just mean one batch - so in my testing, I ran 9 batches with a batch size of 12, and 7 batches with a batch size of 28. Also, the \"normal\" model is the non-dynamic one.\r\nWith the dynamic model, it can run any batch at a batch size less than or equal to the max batch size, so it can run all of the tests without modifying the model input. However, with the normal model, it requires a fixed batch size of 32 as its input, so the various batches with batch sizes 12 and 28 must be padded with extra images to fill them up to the batch size of 32, in this case just empty images created with `np.zeros`.\r\n2. Because the input batch size is constant for the normal model, there is only one measurement for it, and that's 19ms inference on average for the fixed batch size of 32. For the dynamic model, there's two listed measurements, one for each batch size, so a batch size of 12 is about 9ms inference on average and a batch size of 28 is about 18ms inference on average.",
    "sumarized_length": 1054,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR has several implementational issues concerning TensorRT inference and the model's batch size configuration. The primary concern stems from exporting the model with a default maximum batch size of 1, while inference is attempted with a batch size of 2. This discrepancy results in errors. It’s crucial to specify the `--batch-size` argument during export to align with inference requirements, as improper batching leads to failure in dynamic processing.\n\nSubsequent attempts with a specified `--batch-size 16` yield a `ValueError: negative dimensions are not allowed`, indicating a potential issue with the model’s dimensions when loading from the default `ultralytics/yolov5` repository, which lacks updates in `DetectMultiBackend`. Instead, loading from the local path using `torch.hub.load('/content/yolov5', 'custom', 'yolov5s.engine', source='local')` resolved this.\n\nMake sure to persist on local repo loading for custom implementations and appropriately configure batch sizes during both model export and inference for optimal functionality."

    "unsumarized_comments": "hi @glenn-jocher \r\nI have already tested the speed and memory and there are two things we need to discuss:\r\n1) CUDA memory and CPU memory do not change but the training speed will go from 3.0it/s to 1.2s/it due to many `for` loops I used. I tried to remove all the `for` loop by advanced python APIs but it still has to keep the for loop here.[https://github.com/zachluo/yolov5/blob/multi_label_training/utils/loss.py#L192](url) Now the speed is 2.7it/s and still below the original speed. Do you have a better solution?\r\n\r\n2) I add a multi-label flag in train.py to keep the training speed on coco unchanged. Besides, I found that COCO also has a few multi-label annotations, and thus it has to use multi-label to ensure everything unchanged before merging. Am I correct?\n@zachluo that's good on the CPU and CUDA side, but we definitely want to address the speed differences, as the current PR appears to introduce training bottlenecks. This isn't too surprising though, as every part of target assignment and loss calculation is heavily optimized for the absolute fastest speeds.\r\n\r\nI think yes as you said refactor away any for loops with matrix operations if possible, and also we need a global flag to simply skip this logic entirely unless multi-label datasets are detected. The current multi-label strategy is just to repeat a box (or segment) with a new class, i.e.:\r\n\r\nSo we can scan a dataset in the dataloader init and classify it as multi_label or single_label by the presence of non-unique boxes.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n45 0.479492 0.688771 0.955609 0.5955\r\n45 0.736516 0.247188 0.498875 0.476417\r\n50 0.637063 0.732938 0.494125 0.510583  # first class\r\n60 0.637063 0.732938 0.494125 0.510583  # second class (same label)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: I don't think COCO is natively multi-label. Where did you see that?\r\n\n@glenn-jocher \r\n\r\nSure, I think COCO is a single-label dataset. But when I scan the whole training set, I found only one text file with duplicate boxes. So do we need to set a proportion like 10% to classify a dataset as multi-label or single-label?\r\n\r\ncoco/labels/train2017/000000472314.txt\r\n56 0.500000 0.500000 1.000000 1.000000 (duplicate box)\r\n73 0.065773 0.093021 0.129016 0.184667\r\n77 0.467016 0.286917 0.256344 0.390292\r\n15 0.491391 0.603365 0.738281 0.512521\r\n57 0.500000 0.500000 1.000000 1.000000 (duplicate box)\r\n\r\nI also found the `targets` have more duplicate boxes maybe because of augmentation.

Yes then we either want to add a manual --multi-label argument to train.py argparser or make an automated threshold to determine multi-labelness of a dataset, i.e. maybe if >1% of all boxes are duplicated label it multi-label.\n@zachluo right, I see the arguments in train and detect. This creates a risk of user error though as the user needs to set an argument twice at different points in time in two different places, which will not have a 100% efficiency. \r\n\r\nYou can leave the arguments, but we want to handle as much as we can automatically to remove human error, so we should attach a multi-label attribute to the model here and then use this value automatically in detect.py:\r\nhttps://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/0453b758e7ff645528ae52aa85228f3672ff7594/train.py#L246-L256\n@glenn-jocher hi, I encountered this CI issue that the detect.py will load the predefined yolov5n.pt due to this command in the workflow file (python detect.py --weights ${{ matrix.model }}.pt --device $di). As you suggest, I attach a multi-label attribute to the model during training. Thus, the CI error you also mentioned was raised. \r\n\r\nI removed this command (python detect.py --weights ${{ matrix.model }}.pt --device $di) in my workflow file and all the CI testing succeed, but it is not the best way cause it will affect other PR if it is merged to the master branch. What should I do?\r\n\r\nBTW, it requires a review before merging to the master branch.\r\n\n> The code is good, however the code for nms still handle the multi_label case incorrectly. I suggest to change x[:, 5:6] to x[:, 5:] in line 702 and line 716 of file utils/general.py. Also, the file export.py does not has multi_label options too, someone should look into that\r\n\r\n@thuangb Thanks for your suggestion! But x is not the format [center x, center y, width, height, obj_conf,  cls_conf] as you expect, x is now the format [x1, y1, x2, y2, cls_conf, cls] after #692-698 in general.py. So x[:, 5:6] is correct.\r\n\r\nexport.py does not need a multi_label option. What I have done in this PR does not affect the export since the origin master branch has supported multi_label during testing as well as exporting. I just optimized the training details for multi-labels.\n> > The code is good, however the code for nms still handle the multi_label case incorrectly.

I just optimized the training details for multi-labels.\r\n\r\nMay be I has some misunderstanding but can I ask that for multi_label, there is one output with multiple cls or mullltiple outputs with one cls?\r\n\r\nFor example, assume the ground truth has one object with two labels [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] then the output will be [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 1, 2] or  [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 1] and [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 2]?\n> @thuangb it is [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 1] and [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 2]. You can see that from line 694-695 in general.py.\r\n\r\nThen I think we should re-work the nms code to merge multiples output into one output but with multiple cls because when we use multi_label, we want [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 1, 2] more than [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 1] and [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 2]. May be add some code to if two bbox has large IoU and the cls is different then we merge them together? What do you think @zachluo, @glenn-jocher.\n> > @thuangb it is [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 1] and [0, 0, 0, 0, conf, 2].

    "sumarized_length": 1096,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR raises significant concerns regarding training speed impacted by the implementation details within the `loss.py` file. Testing shows that training speed drops from 3.0 it/s to 1.2 it/s, primarily due to multiple nested `for` loops that hinder performance. A suggestion is made to explore advanced Python APIs or matrix operations to mitigate this, retaining a global flag in `train.py` for fallback.\n\nAdditionally, usage of multi-label configurations for COCO dataset annotations is discussed, noting the need to classify datasets based on box duplication. It's proposed to automate this classification with a threshold for duplicate boxes, rather than relying on users to specify a manual argument.\n\nConcerns are also raised about how non-maximum suppression (NMS) handles multi-label cases in the current implementation and the necessity of potentially merging output bounding boxes classified with different labels. Lastly, a CI issue regarding model weight loading and multi-label attributes during training is noted, necessitating improved automation to reduce the risk of user error."

Pr #6984 is just a simple attempt, using trtexec can directly convert the onnx exported by #7736 into an engine, which is shown in my notebook. Since the onnx exported by #7736 cannot be used together with detect.py, I suggest closing #6984 and adding the documentation for exporting using trtexec for #7736.\n> @triple-Mu ok got it! Let's close https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/6984 then and please add the python export.py --include engine --trtexec flag capability to https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/7736 for trtexec engine exports. Can you do that?\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasure to be able to help you, I have the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. If use `python export.py --include engine --trtexec` , does it mean that #7736 the function of `export_onnx` needs to be deleted, which is back to the original version of this pr, and the modified onnx is placed in `export_engine`.\r\n\r\n2. If the current `export_onnx` function is still retained, does it mean that I need to call `export_onnx` and add the \"export_engine_with_trtexec\" function while executing this command.\r\n\n@triple-Mu I think the two topics are separate:\r\n\r\n1. `--trtexec`: I think the original trtexec PR was limited in scope to simply adding a `--trtexec` flag to export.py which ran export via trtexec command instead of tensorrt pip package install (nothing changed about the exported TensorRT models). `python export.py --include engine --trtexec` export appeared to work maybe 2x faster than default (i.e. mabe 2 minutes instead of 4 minutes to export), which could be helpful to users exporting many models.\r\n\r\n2.

This PR appears to implement this well for TensorRT so no additional changes should be needed here.\r\n\r\n@glenn-jocher  All right! \r\nHowever, after registering NMS, onnx cannot be exported normally using `python-tensorrt`, because the instruction ```trt.init_libnvinfer_plugins(trt_logger, namespace=\"\")``` to introduce plugin namespace needs to be added. \r\nIn addition, when the pytorch model is loaded in the main process, it may be affected by problems such as `cuda stream`.\r\nExporting by  trtexec may require opening a new process. \r\nThe above is what I am testing to work on.\r\nIn addition, I would like to ask if you have a social account to connect with?\r\n\r\n\n@glenn-jocher \r\nI'm not sure why I can't export with the following command --`python export.py --weights yolov5s.pt --include engine --trtexec` .  after adding the above. \r\nIf I run this command alone `subprocess.check_output(cmd,shell=True)` , it executes correctly under the new python file. \r\nSo I suspect that it has something to do with pytorch model loading. Is there a conflict between main processes? \r\nLog is as shown:\r\n``` shell\r\n(torch) ubuntu@y9000p:~/work/yolov5$ python export.py --weights yolov5s.pt --include engine --trtexec\r\nexport: data=data/coco128.yaml, weights=['yolov5s.pt'], imgsz=[640, 640], batch_size=1, device=cpu, half=False, inplace=False, train=False, optimize=False, int8=False, dynamic=False, simplify=False, opset=12, verbose=False, workspace=4, trtexec=True, nms=False, agnostic_nms=False, topk_per_class=100, topk_all=100, iou_thres=0.45, conf_thres=0.25, include=['engine']\r\nYOLOv5 🚀 v6.1-224-gba552fe Python-3.8.13 torch-1.11.0+cu115 CPU\r\n\r\nFusing layers... \r\nYOLOv5s summary: 213 layers, 7225885 parameters, 0 gradients\r\n\r\nPyTorch: starting from yolov5s.pt with output shape (1, 25200, 85) (14.1 MB)\r\n[05/19/2022-22:43:30] [W] --workspace flag has been deprecated by --memPoolSize flag.\r\nCuda failure: no CUDA-capable device is detected\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"export.py\", line 646, in <module>\r\n    main(opt)\r\n  File \"export.py\", line 641, in main\r\n    run(**vars(opt))\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/torch/lib/python3.8/site-packages/torch/autograd/grad_mode.py\", line 27, in decorate_context\r\n    return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"export.py\", line 561, in run\r\n    f[1] = export_engine(model, im, file, train, half, simplify, workspace, verbose, trtexec)\r\n  File \"export.py\", line 258, in export_engine\r\n    subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True)\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/torch/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py\", line 415, in check_output\r\n    return run(*popenargs, stdout=PIPE, timeout=timeout, check=True,\r\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/torch/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py\", line 516, in run\r\n    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, process.args,\r\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '/usr/src/tensorrt/bin/trtexec --onnx=yolov5s.onnx --saveEngine=yolov5s.engine --workspace=4096' returned non-zero exit status 134.\r\n```\n@glenn-jocher \r\nGood NEWS!\r\nI recently tried adding NMS to other inference backends like onnxruntime and openvino, and the results were astounding! \r\nJust  modifying a part of the onnx graph can achieve a very good effect. It is worth mentioning that although the --export-type ort flag can be turned on to export the graph with nms, some post-processing operations are still required. \r\nI did not completely place the post-processing in the graph, which may cause the network to output too many tensors.\r\nYou can get all result in notebooks~\nWould greatly appreciate this feature being rolled into the production version. Exporting Object Detection models to something like ONNX with NMS will allow many people to use light weight frameworks on Edge devices or things like AWS Lambda.

    "summarized_comments": "In the PR discussion between @triple-Mu and @glenn-jocher, several specific technical issues were raised regarding the newly proposed `--trtexec` export functionality and its integration with the existing ONNX and NMS features. Key concerns include:\n\n1. **Scope confusion**: Originally, PR #6984 focused on adding `trtexec` support, but its scope expanded, necessitating clarity on overlaps and merge recommendations between PR #6984 and PR #7736.\n  \n2. **Functionality of `export.py`**: There are queries regarding whether the `export_onnx` function should be removed when adding `--trtexec`, and how to ensure that both functionalities coexist without conflicting.\n\n3. **Performance and Errors**: Users noted that exports using `--trtexec` may execute faster but ran into issues like `IndexError` when invoking non_max_suppression with models containing NMS as part of their architecture. This indicates potential integration issues needing resolution.\n\n4. **Output and Debugging**: Anomaly in output predictions (e.g., detections with zero probability) was highlighted, with a suggestion for a secondary filtering mechanism on outputs to handle this. \n\n5. **Input shape sensitivity**: A specific issue was identified regarding the input tensor shape, which must match the exported ONNX shape for successful inference."

Although his performance is better, we all use model pruning so that he can be distributed on any device.  Therefore, I look forward to a new YOLOv4/YOLOv5.

understand the YAML file. I observe from your, mine, and @zh9369 error report that is a problem with a number of filters in cfg file, which we chose corresponding to our class number. In my case,  no of classes was 12 and the corresponding filters were 51, so my error was something like this `RuntimeError: Given groups=1, the weight of size [1, 51, 1, 1], expected input[1, 1024, .., ..]` In the same way I hope your filters number corresponding to your class number is 30. But all in our case it's showing 1024 and a mismatch occurs. Now looking towards @glenn-jocher (If I am not wrong in understanding) can you please tell where we can make changes at the exact place in our YAML file to solve this mismatch issue.\ntry this,

    "summarized_comments": "In response to the dataset evaluation, it was noted that PANet shows improved performance over FPN for small and medium object detection, with Average Precision (AP) increasing from 28.3 to 30.3 for small objects. However, concerns were raised about the underlying theory as PANet seems to perform better for small objects contrary to expectations. A critical examination of the custom dataset's object size and the implementation of mosaic augmentation techniques was suggested for further insight.\n\nArchitecturally, adjustments to the YOLOv4 configuration YAML file were discussed due to reported runtime errors stemming from a mismatch in filter sizes relative to class numbers. This highlights the necessity for developers to customize the filter count in the configuration according to the specified class counts to prevent said errors. Further improvements in the training pipeline and layers need to be assessed to enhance accuracy when compared with YOLOv5 and YOLOv3."

    "unsumarized_comments": "@KAKAROT12419 glad you've cloned the repository! Regarding the MAUC score showing as 0 on each iteration, there might be an issue with the dataset or the calculation logic. As for the Python version, the YOLOv5-AUROC-MedDetect repository should indeed be compatible with Python 3.9. You may need to review the code and dataset to address the MAUC score calculation and ensure Python 3.9 compatibility. Let me know if you need further assistance!\n@KAKAROT12419 i understand your confusion. The AUC score calculation and the precision and recall calculation may have different underlying logic and may not be impacted in the same way by dataset issues. I recommend reviewing the AUC calculation logic in the repository and ensuring that it aligns with your expectations. If you need further clarification, feel free to reach out to the repository owner for additional insight.\n> Thanks sir i have cloned that repo, but it is showing mAUC score 0 on every iteration and one more problem it is using python 2.7 instead if 3.9 .\r\n\r\nProblems with AUC values of 0 at each iteration: can I ask you if the values within the CONFUSION MATRICES at the end of training all show 0? Since I'm using similar logic to the confusion matrices to filter for matches between predicted and true bounding boxes, the values between the two should correlate with each other.\r\n\r\nAll or individual category AUC scores may indeed appear to be 0 at the beginning of training, and the situation may ease as training time increases. If your data labels are very unbalanced, then rare labels are likely to have an AUC value of 0.\r\n\r\nI invite you to read class AUROC in metrics.py. It contains the logic for calculating AUC scores.\r\n\r\nThe python version is theoretically the same as yolov5.\n@haooyuee i understand this situation can be perplexing. Regarding the AUC score being 0 at each iteration, it's helpful to check if the values within the CONFUSION MATRICES at the end of training all show 0. The AUC scores can start at 0 and increase as training progresses, especially for rare labels in unbalanced datasets. You can review the logic for calculating AUC scores in the class AUROC in metrics.py for more insight. Also, the Python version used should be consistent with YOLOv5. Let me know if you need any further assistance!\n@KAKAROT12419 i understand the challenge you're facing. In the context of a chest X-ray dataset with only one class and a true negative confusion matrix value of 0, it's expected for the AUC score to be 0. Since the AUC score heavily depends on true negatives, this can impact the score when working with imbalanced datasets or single-class detection. It's unlikely that changing hyperparameters will affect this, as it's a fundamental characteristic of the dataset. If you have further questions or need assistance with any other aspect, feel free to let me know.\n@KAKAROT12419 you're welcome! If you need to change the value of IOU to 0.20 while keeping the threshold value the same, it seems aligned with the specifications from the research paper. Feel free to proceed with this adjustment. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, don't hesitate to ask!\nThank you so much, Sir, I wanted to ask do I need to change all these iou values,\r\nval.py\r\n    parser.add_argument('--iou-thres', type=float, default=0.6, help='NMS IoU threshold')\r\nopt.conf_thres, opt.iou_thres, opt.save_json = 0.25, 0.20, False\r\n iou_thres=0.6,  # NMS IoU threshold\r\nIn train.py\r\niou_thres=0.65 if is_coco else 0.60,  # best pycocotools at iou 0.65\n@KAKAROT12419 You're welcome! Yes, to align the IOU threshold with the specifications from the research paper, you should update all instances of the IOU threshold values in the code, including those in val.py and train.py, as you've mentioned. Please ensure that the IOU threshold values are consistently updated across all relevant sections of the code. If you have any other queries or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n@KAKAROT12419 It seems that the issue with the confusion matrix displaying false positives for the background class and true negatives as 0 might be related to how the single class dataset is being handled. This could indeed impact the MAUC score. You could consider modifying the dataset handling or the model inputs to ensure that there is proper segmentation of the classes. Additionally, analysing the ground truth annotations and the model outputs might provide insights into the cause of the issue. If you need further assistance or have other questions, feel free to ask!",
    "sumarized_length": 954,
    "summarized_comments": "This PR discussion highlights several concrete technical concerns and implementation suggestions. Firstly, the MAUC score consistently showing as 0 suggests potential issues with the dataset or calculation logic, particularly the confusion matrices. It's critical to verify if the confusion matrices exhibit all zeros, which may indicate challenges with single-class datasets and unbalanced labels impacting AUC calculations. Review the AUC calculation logic in the AUROC class within metrics.py for alignment. \n\nAdditionally, ensure compatibility with Python 3.9, as the reference to Python 2.7 may affect functionality. When it comes to adjusting the IoU thresholds, all relevant instances in val.py and train.py should be updated consistently to meet research specifications. Lastly, reevaluate the dataset handling and model inputs to address false positives and improve MAUC scoring. Consider analyzing ground truth annotations for further insights."

Seems like aten::nonzero is required for the indexing op on loss.py L208, as well as in NMS. I would stop using PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1 and start debugging loss.py L208 to see if you can restructure this op in a different way that bypasses the aten:nonzero requirement.

Perhaps you need to use torch.nonzero to get True indices on the boolean vector and then that might work. https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nonzero.html\n@mohammed-ab99 well yes, ideally the torch team should fix this but without a clear schedule we should try to debug alternative implementations on our end, making sure to profile any changes for speed differences.\nI am running into the same issue that @mohammed-ab99 is having https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/7878#issuecomment-1178328701\r\n\r\nI attempted to replace `t[j]` to `t = torch.index_select(t,dim=0, index=j.nonzero().int().reshape(-1))`, but I am running into an issue when I test on CPU with the following error:\r\n```\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 667, in <module>\r\n    main(opt)\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 562, in main\r\n    train(opt.hyp, opt, device, callbacks)\r\n  File \"train.py\", line 353, in train\r\n    loss, loss_items = compute_loss(pred, targets.to(device))  # loss scaled by batch_size\r\n  File \"/Users/mendeza/Documents/projects/yolov5/utils/loss.py\", line 125, in __call__\r\n    tcls, tbox, indices, anchors = self.build_targets(p, targets)  # targets\r\n  File \"/Users/mendeza/Documents/projects/yolov5/utils/loss.py\", line 219, in build_targets\r\n    t = torch.index_select(t,dim=0, index=j_ind.reshape(-1))\r\nIndexError: index out of range in self\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am able to show that index_select with nonzero is the same as indexing on nonzero for 2D case, but 3D I am having a hard time how to reshape:\r\n```\r\ne = torch.eye(2)\r\nshap = e.shape\r\ne2 = e.index_select(0,index=e.nonzero().int().flatten()).reshape(shap[0],-1,shap[1])\r\nprint(torch.equal(e[e.nonzero()],e2))\r\n\r\n```\n```\r\n\r\n      Epoch    GPU_mem   box_loss   obj_loss   cls_loss  Instances       Size\r\n  0%|          | 0/75 [00:00<?, ?it/s]/AppleInternal/Library/BuildRoots/91a344b1-f985-11ee-b563-fe8bc7981bff/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/MetalPerformanceShaders/MPSCore/Types/MPSNDArray.mm:124: failed assertion `[MPSNDArrayDescriptor sliceDimension:withSubrange:] error: subRange.start (3) is not less than length of dimension[1] (3)'\r\nzsh: abort      python train.py --weight yolov5x.pt --data  --device mps\r\n```\r\n我使用的是m1max芯片的mac，在使用train.py文件的时候提示这个报错，这是什么问题\r\n\nHello @xxxkkw,\n\nThank you for reporting this issue. It appears that you're encountering an assertion error related to the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend on your M1 Max chip when running the training script.\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Verify Package Versions**:\n   Ensure you are using the latest versions of PyTorch and YOLOv5. You can update your packages with the following commands:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio\n   pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git\n   ```\n\n2. **Check MPS Compatibility**:\n   The MPS backend is still relatively new and may have some limitations. Make sure you are using the nightly builds of PyTorch, which include the latest updates and fixes for MPS:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify the Code**:\n   Based on your previous attempts, it seems like the issue might be related to how tensors are being indexed. You can try the following modification to handle the 3D case properly:\n   ```python\n   t = torch.index_select(t, dim=0, index=j.nonzero(as_tuple=False).squeeze())\n   ```\n\n4. **Fallback to CPU**:\n   If the issue persists, you might want to fallback to CPU or CUDA (if available) until the MPS backend matures:\n   ```bash\n   python train.py --device cpu\n   ```\n\n### Example Code:\nHere's a snippet to help you with the tensor indexing:\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Example tensor\nt = torch.randn(3, 5, 7)\nj = torch.tensor([True, False, True])\n\n# Indexing with nonzero\nt = torch.index_select(t, dim=0, index=j.nonzero(as_tuple=False).squeeze())\nprint(t.shape)\n```\n\n### Reporting Bugs:\nIf the issue is reproducible with the latest versions, please consider opening a bug report on the [PyTorch GitHub repository](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues) with detailed information about your setup and the error message.\n\nThank you for your patience and contributions to improving YOLOv5! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR discussion highlights several technical challenges and suggested resolutions when using the MPS device on Apple's M1 chip for training YOLOv5. The user experiences a persistent `RuntimeError` related to float64 types when running `train.py --device mps`, suggesting that the code should enforce float32 types since MPS does not support float64. There is also an issue with unsupported operations leading to potential CPU fallbacks, specifically referencing the `aten::nonzero` operation. An actionable suggestion was made to replace `t[j]` with `torch.index_select(t, dim=0, index=j.nonzero().int().reshape(-1))`, though this led to an `IndexError`, necessitating a rightly defined tensor shape handling method. Users are encouraged to ensure that the latest versions of PyTorch and YOLOv5 are installed and to explore alternatives for data indexing to bypass limitations with MPS, underlining the importance of ongoing debugging and community collaboration."

If you can figure out a way to pass a string directly to the function, it'll work.\r\n\r\nJust fyi too, the cpu support is there, however the trained model is for cuda. So, you'll need to train a new checkpoint. There's where I'm currently at.\nAlright, I think I might have fixed your issue. I'm still working on getting Qt to work with wsl, and a x server... So, you might have to be my gui tester for now.\nIn your pip usage, make sure you use 3.7, the libraries only work up to python 3.7.x. you'll see that as the very first line in requirements.txt.\n\nFor tensorflow 1.15.x, you can use pip, or conda. Sometimes anaconda is much easier to control the versions by using specific channels.\nI'm getting a virtual machine up and running, so I can work on the gui portion. We'll see where that goes.\r\n\r\nThe dll issue must be a windows thing. I'm not sure how it loads tensorflow in windows, never used it. Right now, I'm going to debug the qt gui. Next I'll see how hard it is to use windows. In the mean time, if you use wsl like I am, it'll stream line things quite a bit.\n@adrifcastr Alright, I think the issues are fixed with the windows version. I made a .bat file for setup. FYI, pytorch had to be my first install on conda, then with the conda prompt, use pip install for the rest. You may need a new env, or reinstall if you get weird errors. I can confirm though the cpu processing does work on windows.\nAlright guys. That should be it. Windows good. GUI good on linux. Just need to train a CPU model now.\r\n\r\nI'll probably start hosting some of the files on my own server so the download for models and datasets can be automated as well.\n@Knucklesfan Good deal. Good to hear. Yes, the warnings are due to the fact the package uses tensforflow's apiv1, so it'll warning to say change those function calls to update to apiv2. Eventually I'll update them so we can migrate to the latest version.\r\n\r\nThe only true \"error\" that I've seen thus far, is something like this.\r\n`Loading checkpoint: synthesizer\\saved_models\\logs-pretrained\\taco_pretrained\\tacotron_model.ckpt-278000\r\n2020-05-01 13:08:29.021006: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:142] Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use: AVX2\r\n2020-05-01 13:08:29.033412: W tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:55] Could not load dynamic library 'nvcuda.dll'; dlerror: nvcuda.dll not found`\r\n\r\nThat's what the windows error looks like when synthesizing. Linux will say something about failure to load checkpoint. This is due to the fact the checkpoint was produced using cuda, and not a cpu. So there's no model method to recall that checkpoint. I'll have to train a new model, solely on a cpu, and then upload that for usage.\r\n\r\nAs far as it goes though, the program should all run just fine now on cpu only.\n@Knucklesfan Is see the warning now. It's due to librosa calling on numba, when numba is deprecating the import. So, I updated the call on librosa, and submitted a pull request. That'll update librosa for when numba 0.50.0 rolls out.\r\n\r\nI also updated this program to use soundfile to write the resultant wav file to disk, since librosa deprecated the write to file function. So, we're now ready for librosa 0.8.0. Whew... LOL\r\n\r\nNow I just need to work on tensorflow. I've already implemented a few changes, including while reading the docs to more effective functions for performance.\n@Knucklesfan Will do. My only goals left for the software is to get tensorflow 2.0 working. Then I can implement a version for using AMD compute. That'll essentially cover all the bases I think at that point. Nothing really more than could be done. Anything left is just simple maintenance.",

The initial error reported is a `TypeError` indicating an invalid file type when loading audio files, specifically related to the use of `pathlib`.

Currently, a folder called workspace is created.\r\n- See my comments in the PR\r\n\r\nAlso, small optional improvements:\r\n- Make the \"user file_txt\" option for selecting files first and default\r\n- Number the file selection alternatives from 1 (not 0)\r\n- Consider not listing any `venv` or `node_modules` folders (as they have so many files)\nOne more thing:\r\n\r\nWe can simplify the \"improve code\" prompt, and use another final system message focused on explicitly requesting the output to be in the format we want, just like the `gen_code` step does (it uses the `use_qa` prompt).\r\n\r\nI think we should do it.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried it, it didn't give the right format (see screenshot)\r\n<img width=\"409\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/assets/4467025/aebe45e2-f197-4969-83c8-53a32cc3153b\">\r\n\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR introduces features for file selection and code improvement. Key concerns include:\n\n1. **File Naming and Complexity:** Simplify user interaction by dropping the requirement for `file_paths.txt`. Instead, consider creating separate files like `chat_to_files` and `files_to_chat`. A streamlined selection process is suggested using CLI or GUI methods, including toggling file/folder selection with arrow keys or editing command output in a text editor.\n\n2. **Error Handling and Validation:** Implement exception handling for file operations in `gpt_engineer/chat_to_files.py` to prevent crashes due to permission issues. Validate the `improve_option` argument in `gpt_engineer/main.py` to ensure it is a boolean.\n\n3. **Code Refactoring:** The `ask_for_files` function in `gpt_engineer/file_selector.py` and `improve_existing_code` in `gpt_engineer/steps.py` should be refactored for improved readability and maintainability.\n\n4. **Testing:** It’s essential to add unit and integration tests to validate the new features.\n\n5. **Miscellaneous Improvements:** Address minor enhancements like defaulting to file selection, numbering options from 1, and excluding `venv` or `node_modules` from listings."

I mostly use gpte like this\r\n```\r\n$ cd path/to/gpte/venv\r\n$ pipenv shell\r\n$ gpt-engineer -i path/to/project\r\n```\r\nSo, the execution path (`path/to/gpte/venv`) and project path (`path/to/project`) are different.\r\n\r\nIn principle, there is no downside to using relative locations to the project path. We would then have make sure gpte-internal files are not editable. \r\n\r\nIirc, there's a proposal to move all of those things into a `.gpt-engineer` folder, right? We could then just exclude that folder.\nI think we need to decide how we want to structure the gpte directory. We have two options:\r\n1. root dir is for gtpe, a subdir (eg \"workspace\") is for the code\r\n2. root dir is for code, a subdir (eg \".gptengineer\") is for gpte\r\n\r\nWe currently do 1, but when we want the ability to edit existing codebases, 2 would be easier. @AntonOsika @ATheorell @pbharrin thoughts?\r\n\r\nWhen that's decided, then I can finish this PR.\r\n\nI now went ahead and made a PR to use the project path as workplace and move everything else into `.gpteng` - see #749.

Additionally, there is a call for refactoring the part of `parse_chat` responsible for updating the README file to avoid overwriting it continuously.\n\n3. **Feature Addition Clarity:** There was confusion about whether `gpt-engineer` only modifies existing files or also adds new ones. The reviewer emphasized the need for the system to handle new features appropriately without wiping the workspace.\n\n4. **Error Handling:** Concerns were raised with specific error cases, such as a `ValueError` occurring if GPT generates non-code outputs. The PR needs to address how to handle varying output types from the LLM.\n\n5. **Directory Structure:** A proposal was made to allow more flexibility regarding the workspace directory structure, suggesting it could either reside in a dedicated subdirectory or within the project folder, which could improve UX when managing existing codebases.

These are only small changes and we are close to the goal! @similato87\r\n\r\nHi @ATheorell ,\r\n\r\nThank you for your valuable feedback and suggestions! Here's a brief outline addressing each point of your wishlist:\r\n\r\n1. **Improved Editor Detection**: I'll enhance the `open_with_default_editor` function to cycle through a list of common editors (vim, notepad, gedit, nano) if `EDITOR` isn't defined. This should make the feature more robust across different environments.\r\n\r\n2. **Default Selection State**: Changing the default selection state to false in the .toml file is a sensible idea, especially for large projects. I'll implement this adjustment.\r\n\r\n3. **Filtering Non-UTF-8 Files**: Incorporating a check for UTF-8 encoding to filter out files like .pyc makes a lot of sense. I'll add this feature to ensure only editable text files are included in the .toml.\r\n\r\n4. **Persisting .toml and Removing file_list.txt**: Shifting to persisting the .toml file for future selections and eliminating the older file_list.txt approach will streamline the process and maintain consistency. I'll ensure that the .toml file is the primary reference for repeated runs.\r\n\r\nI'm on it and will update the PR with these enhancements soon. Thanks for the encouragement and detailed insights.\r\n\r\n\nHi!\r\nI see that you solved 1-3 above great @similato87!\r\nI tested again and I have some input for 4. The persisted file is called toml now, but the content is not the .toml file, but the content of the old file_list, but you may already be aware of this.\r\n\r\nI want to suggest a small change to the workflow: The current workflow is that, after the first run, a .toml is persisted and the next time we run, gpt-engineer immediately assumes we want to use the files in that .toml.

Your clear and timely suggestion for the .toml workflow and content is incredibly helpful and encouraging. It points out necessary improvements and provides a user-centered perspective that's crucial for refinement.\r\n\r\nThe idea to automatically open the .toml file for review and the addition of an explanatory comment will enhance the user experience significantly. I'm also carefully considering the options for the command line selection to best suit user preferences.\r\n\r\nYour input is greatly valued as I work towards making this tool more reliable and intuitive. Thank you for your supportive and constructive feedback!\nNever mind -- that wasn't it. I've checked out your branch and its failing in test execution. Please run `poetry run pytest` locally and work through the errors.\nRegarding the error: To run the tests on github without an api key, we use a caching system. When a change in the code changes a prompt to the LLM in one of the tests, the cache needs to be updated locally. If you run pytest locally, you should see that here is a cache file that gets updated and you need to commit that. If this isn't working for you for some reason, feel free to simple ignore this error and I will update the cache before we merge this @similato87 @captivus . \r\n\r\nI believe a ToDo for me is to make a better error message.\nI only have tiny nitpicks left before merging now:\r\n\r\nAfter choosing files, there is a print to the consol which is formatted a little strangely. I get this for example:\r\n```\r\nYou have selected the following files:\r\n\r\n│   └──  controller.py\r\n```\r\nIt would probably be more informative if it prints the relative path.\r\n\r\nThanks for adding the instruction:\r\n\r\n\"# Select or Deselect files for processing by setting 'selected' to true or false.\"\r\n\r\nWhat about the slightly more informative:\r\n\r\n\"# Change 'selected' from false to true to include files in the edit. GPT-engineer can only read and edit the files that set to true. Including irrelevant files will degrade coding performance, cost additional tokens and potentially lead to violations of the token limit, resulting in runtime errors.\"\nOne more small UX thingy: If I set all files to false, I get this in the terminal \r\n```\r\nNo files were selected.\r\n```\r\nand then the program commences, but can't do anything. \r\nIf the user selects nothing, it would probably be better to directly raise an informative error and not waste any more tokens.\r\n\n> The .gitignore file wasn't properly ignoring the projects directory. This has been resolved in #939. Please update your branch with this change and let us know if the issue persists.\r\n\r\nHi @captivus,\r\nThank you for addressing the `.gitignore` issue with the projects directory in #939. I've updated my branch with these changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears the root cause was different. The issue stemmed from updates I made to the file_selector workflow, which I hadn't realized affected specific tests. I'll provide more details in the comment after the next one.\n> I only have tiny nitpicks left before merging now:\r\n> \r\n> After choosing files, there is a print to the consol which is formatted a little strangely.

If the user selects nothing, it would probably be better to directly raise an informative error and not waste any more tokens.\r\n\r\nIndeed! Now there is an exception for no file selection situation instead of printing no file selection.\n> Regarding the error: To run the tests on github without an api key, we use a caching system.

Feel free to ask for support if you feel like the scope of this is getting too wide.\nHi @ATheorell,\r\n\r\nI've been progressing on implementing tests for the improved file selection workflow, but I've encountered a significant challenge that I'd like to discuss. The core of the issue is simulating user interactions within a default text editor during the tests. Specifically, our improve process involves opening a file in the default editor, making changes (such as selecting or deselecting files), and then saving and closing the editor during this line running:https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/b95e179ca798deb9dc882a2cd90b2a51b9779953/tests/applications/cli/test_main.py#L79 — a sequence that's straightforward for a human user but complex to automate in a testing environment.\r\n\r\nI am exploring potential methods to effectively simulate this behavior in our automated tests but haven't yet found a robust solution. \nHi @ATheorell ,\r\n\r\nHappy new year:)\r\n\r\nI've made progress on the test cases and have successfully fixed them in my local development environment. However, when I push the changes to run in the GitHub workflow, they fail.\r\n\r\nUpon reviewing the logs, it seems like the issue might be related to hitting a maximum limit. So, I initiated a new run thinking it might resolve any temporary issues, but unfortunately, the tests are still failing.\r\n\r\nI'm currently unsure of the next steps to rectify this issue. It's unclear if the problem is with the environment setup, dependencies, or something else entirely that differs between the local and CI environments.\r\n\r\nAny insights or suggestions you might have would be greatly appreciated as I navigate this issue.\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.\nHi @ATheorell ,\r\n\r\nI've completed the refactoring and commenting of the file selection module. Detailed comments have been added throughout to improve maintainability and understanding.\r\n\r\nCould you please review and merge the PR? And now I'm ready to move on to the next feature development.\r\n\r\nThanks!\n> Was there an issue with the file selector box or a reason we dont want to support it? It seems to me the easiest option for non technical users to select files so im wodering if replacing it is removing some functionality for users\r\n\r\nHi @TheoMcCabe ,\r\n\r\nWe've updated the file selection in GPT-engineer for these reasons:\r\n\r\n1. **Multi-file Selection**: The new method inspired by [issue #725](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/issues/725) allows easier multi-file selection across directories, replacing the limited GUI with a more intuitive tree representation.\r\n\r\n2. **Persistent Selections**: Users' selections are now saved in a .toml file, allowing for easy re-use and modification in subsequent runs without needing to reselect every time.\r\n\r\n3. **Direct Editing**: Users can directly edit their file selections in their preferred text editors with the new .toml method, leveraging familiar functionalities and enhancing the user experience.\r\n\r\n4. **Advanced Configuration**: The .toml file allows for more advanced configurations like excluding patterns, using comments for organization, and managing multiple sets of selections, offering greater flexibility and control.\n> One enhancement to include only if you have time and want to:\r\n> \r\n> One of the biggest issues with file selecting at the moment IMO is when new files are created by gpteng they arent added to the file selection list. could we make it so that any new files created are automatically added to the improve list?\r\n\r\nThat's a great suggestion!\r\n\r\nCurrently, all files are set to `selected: false` by default in the .toml file for user convenience, especially in large projects. This is akin to an unselected checkbox, allowing users to explicitly choose what they want to include.\r\n\r\nI agree that automatically adding newly created files by gpteng to the file selection list would enhance the user experience. We can offer this as an option, toggling between automatic inclusion or the current manual selection. This would require a discussion on recognizing and handling patterns of newly generated files, which I'll bring up with @ATheorell  to consider implementation strategies.\n@similato87 and @TheoMcCabe \r\n\r\nTo the discussion about the GUI selection tool I wanted to add: The GUI selection tool was also more difficult to maintain, with different OS's returning paths in different formats, leading to errors. For now, I think its fair to remove it.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier for non-technical users, I would suggest that we reorder the list of default text editors and put the most beginner friendly ones first. Something like this:\r\n\r\ngedit\r\nnotepad\r\nwrite\r\nnano\r\nvim\r\nemacs\r\n\r\nIt is easy for the advanced users to get their preferred editor anyway by setting the environment variable. Another advantage with this setup is that vim doesn't open nicely in my IDE.\r\n\r\nTheo's second suggestion would be really nice to have, though it will require some code. I would go about it like this:\r\nInstead of adding files to the toml directely when new files are created, add an additional check at the beginning of each improve run. Something like:\r\n\r\ndefault_toml_string = create_file_toml\r\nif file_selection_toml from previous runs exist:\r\n  file_selection_toml = merge(file_selection.toml, default_toml_string)\r\nelse:\r\n  file_selection_toml = default_toml_string\r\nopen file_selection_toml for user inspection (as usual)\r\n\r\nThis workflow is nice because it not only catches changes on disc from gpt-engineer, but also any other changes. It requires one new merge operation, which updates the old toml to contain the same files as the default toml, while keeping the selected property form the old toml.\r\n\r\n\n> @similato87 and @TheoMcCabe\r\n> \r\n> To the discussion about the GUI selection tool I wanted to add: The GUI selection tool was also more difficult to maintain, with different OS's returning paths in different formats, leading to errors.

I'll be working on implementing the reordering of text editors as well as integrating Theo's suggestion for automatically including new files in the improve list. I'll start on these tasks today and will keep you posted on the progress.\nHi @ATheorell ,\r\n\r\nI've completed the merge of the new files feature. Currently, I'm working on refactoring the file. \r\n\r\nHowever, I've encountered an issue. It seems that commit `a6252cc0` titled \"Fixes to tests and paths rel to cwd/project dir\" might be causing a problem. Specifically, I'm looking at this line of code: [gpt_engineer/applications/cli/file_selector.py#L368](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/a6252cc0700e23049e53cafd009fdce8b2fa0d12/gpt_engineer/applications/cli/file_selector.py#L368). It appears to cause issues upon the first run after the improvements. I'm not sure if adding a relative path for testing causes a problem to the make tree function and now I am working on it. \r\n\n> Hi @ATheorell ,\r\n> \r\n> I've completed the merge of the new files feature.

It was indeed related to the way file paths instead of directory paths were being passed into the `make_tree` function. To address this, I've implemented a `dir_check` within `make_tree` to ensure the directory structure is correctly recognized. Additionally, I've updated the display functions to align with this new implementation.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all mentioned features have been done. I've conducted thorough tests in most running scenarios and haven't encountered any errors post these changes and I will do more tests and refactors tomorrow.\nGreat! Also happy to merge, but waiting for some of @captivus, @TheoMcCabe , @AntonOsika , @pbharrin to give green light.\r\n\r\nFor the merge conflict: the easiest thing would be if you rebase the branch of this PR on the new main locally and then push back to this PR. It doesn't matter which version of the cache you keep in the rebase. You can simply delete it and recreate it by running pytest one time locally.",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comments provide a detailed review of the current implementation and suggest various enhancements. Key technical concerns include:\n\n1. **Enhanced Default Editor Handling**: The `open_with_default_editor` function should be improved to attempt a list of potential editors (like vim, notepad, gedit, nano) if the `EDITOR` environment variable isn't defined, enhancing cross-environment compatibility.\n\n2. **TOML File Default Settings**: Change the TOML file's default selected state to false for better usability, especially in larger projects where changing many files can be cumbersome.\n\n3. **File Filtering Improvements**: Instead of relying solely on `_is_in_ignoring_extensions_`, it is recommended to check file encodings. Implementing a UTF-8 check will help filter out non-editable files.\n\n4. **Workflow Adjustments**: Shift to persisting the TOML file instead of `file_list.txt`, offering better tracking of user selections. It's suggested that, upon detecting an existing TOML file, it should always be opened in the default editor for user review, improving workflow fluidity.\n\n5. **User Experience Enhancements**: Update print formatting to show relative paths and provide more informative error messages when no files are selected. Additionally, a top-of-file comment in the TOML to explain usage is proposed.\n\n6. **Testing Consistency**: Addresses issues in automated tests being affected by recent changes; advising to ensure all tests align with the improved file selection workflow.\n\n7. **File Selector GUI Considerations**: Discusses removing the GUI file selector due to maintenance difficulties and proposing a reordering"

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment raises specific technical issues regarding the `execute_workspace` functionality, suggesting that a different prompt/function will be necessary due to upstream changes breaking the current implementation. Key implementation suggestions include adopting a `write_files` function to enhance the output file management. The proposed structure using an array of objects for filenames and contents is deemed more semantic than the current approach of parallel arrays. Security considerations are implicit in ensuring that this function call replaces regular expression parsing thereby improving stability and accuracy when handling outputs from GPT.\n\nThere’s concern about having to call the function multiple times for each file, which is inefficient in terms of token usage. A recommendation is made to use a single function call to handle multiple file outputs. Finally, there's consensus that the new function calling capability from OpenAI should be leveraged for more accurate parsing, and the merging philosophy emphasizes minimal code changes focusing on addressing known issues without leaving TODOs."

It should state \"Cannot divide by zero\" instead of \"Cannot divide by two.\"\r\nOUTPUT:\r\nFile: calculator.py\r\n2 -     def add(self, a, b):\r\n3 -         return a * b\r\n2 +     def add(self, a, b):\r\n3 +         # Returns the sum of a and b\r\n3 +         return a + b\r\n5 -     def subtract(self, a, b):\r\n6 -         return a / b\r\n5 +     def subtract(self, a, b):\r\n6 +         # Returns the difference of a and b\r\n6 +         return a - b\r\n8 -     def multiply(self, a, b):\r\n9 -         return a & b\r\n8 +     def multiply(self, a, b):\r\n9 +         # Returns the product of a and b\r\n9 +         return a * b\r\n11 -     def divide(self, a, b):\r\n12 -         if b == 2:\r\n13 -             raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\r\n11 +     def divide(self, a, b):\r\n12 +         # Raises an error if b is zero and returns the quotient of a and b otherwise\r\n12 +         if b == 0:\r\n13 +             raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\r\n14 +         return a / b\r\n```\r\nHowever, the conversion of these planned edits back into the code file isn't working as expected. I suspect the issue may be related to the recent changes in this commit: [b9e0e86](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/pull/965/commits/b9e0e86c5bd63831649e343d215210d8bc3df983). I plan to dive deeper into this tomorrow to identify and fix the root cause.\nHi @ATheorell,\r\n\r\nI've updated the code parsing functionality. Using the `parse_edits` function, I've successfully parsed the chat content into structured edits. Here's a quick summary of what I extracted:\r\n```\r\nSkipped line: OUTPUT:\r\nBefore edit: ['def add(self, a, b):', 'return a * b']\r\nAfter edit: ['def add(self, a, b):', '# Perform addition', 'return a + b']\r\nBefore edit: ['def subtract(self, a, b):', 'return a / b']\r\nAfter edit: ['def subtract(self, a, b):', '# Perform subtraction', 'return a - b']\r\nBefore edit: ['def multiply(self, a, b):', 'return a & b']\r\nAfter edit: ['def multiply(self, a, b):', '# Perform multiplication', 'return a * b']\r\nBefore edit: ['def divide(self, a, b):', 'if b == 2:', 'raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")']\r\nAfter edit: ['def divide(self, a, b):', '# Perform division with error handling for division by zero', 'if b == 0:', 'raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")', 'return a / b']\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on the `apply_edits` function to integrate these edits into the existing code. This should be the last primary step to make it run. It's running successfully in several instances but not consistently. \r\n\r\nOne notable observation is that the chat-generated content from the LLM sometimes includes changes to a \"prompt\" file, and even attempts to delete it. While I've managed to filter these out during parsing, I think a more efficient approach might be to instruct the LLM not to apply changes to the \"prompt\" file in its pre-prompt phase. This could streamline the process and prevent unnecessary edits from being generated.\nA thing I thought about regarding the parsing. The way to remove lines when parsing is probably this:\r\n\r\n1) look at a group of suggested line numbers with a '-' that the LLM suggests.\r\n2) go to the corresponding lines in the code.\r\n3) check if the content in the code is roughly the same as the *before* code in the diff from the LLM, if not, throw warning that edit is infeasible. Otherwise, remove all lines with minus and add all lines with +.\r\n\r\nThe advantage with this, over exchanging lines based directly on the \"before\" code that the LLM produces, is that small inconsistencies in the before code may lead to a mismatch. To the contrary, the line number is an unambiguous guide to what line to replace.\r\n\nHi @ATheorell ,\r\n\r\nI'm happy to share that our `improve` function has made advancements. It can now simultaneously handle a variety of complex tasks:\r\n\r\n1. **Strict Adherence to Prompts:** The function can interpret and execute instructions with precision, ensuring that the output closely aligns with the given prompt.\r\n\r\n2. **Applicability to Both New and Existing Files:** It's now equipped to apply changes to both newly created files and existing ones, enhancing its versatility.\r\n\r\n3. **Automatic Error Correction:** The function can autonomously identify and rectify common errors, both syntactical and logical, without the need for specific prompts.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are still some potential inefficiencies. For instance, issues like incorrect indentation(Only if the input file has this issue) or unintended attempts to delete the prompt file may occur, though the probability of these issues is relatively low, approximately 1 in 5.\r\n\r\n**Request for Testing and Feedback:**\r\nAxel, would you be able to test this commit when you have time? I would appreciate your feedback. :)\r\n\r\n# My lastest run:\r\n## Input 2 files:\r\n**`prompt`:**\r\n```\r\nA very simple calculator.

Additionally, we will create a new file named `main.py` for user interaction with the calculator functions.\r\n\r\n1. In the `add` method, change the subtraction operator to the addition operator to correct the logical error.\r\n2. Fix the syntax error in the `subtract` method by adding a colon at the end of the method definition.\r\n3. Replace the lambda function in the `multiply` method with a simple multiplication operation, which is the correct and efficient way to perform multiplication.\r\n4. In the `modulo` method, change the single equals sign to a double equals sign to correct the syntax error in the conditional statement.\r\n5. Change the return value from `None` to raising a `ValueError` in the `modulo` method to maintain consistency with the `divide` method error handling.\r\n6. In the `power` method, correct the logical error by checking if `b` is negative and then using the `abs` function to handle the negative exponent correctly.\r\n\r\nAfter correcting the `calculator.py` file, we will create a new file `main.py` that will import the `Calculator` class and allow the user to interact with it.

Now the `improve`model relies on GPT to generate formatted code, which can be resource-intensive and may not always correctly handle indentation errors. Additionally, this method increases the complexity of the preprompt.\r\n\r\nGiven that we're considering moving black from a development dependency to a common dependency, it would be beneficial to fully utilize it for both improved mode and regular code generation. This will ensure consistency in code formatting across all outputs.\r\n\r\nTo streamline our development process, I propose creating a separate PR specifically for integrating black into our normal code generation process. I can initiate this by writing an issue to outline the feature and its implementation details.\nSome boundary issues are still encountered during testing, especially with more complex tasks. I'm optimistic about resolving these by tomorrow. I've drafted a summary of this PR and plan to tag others for review tomorrow.\r\n\r\nInteresting test fact found: sometimes LLM destroys the whole original file to rewrite it, which leads to some \"override exact code line\" mismatches:) \r\n\r\nI'm working on it to try to fix it and do more testing.\r\n",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR addresses several technical issues regarding the parsing and application of edits within the `improve` function. Concerns were raised about the handling of chat content conversions, specifically regarding the `apply_edits` function which is intended to integrate parsed content back into files. It was noted that there are discrepancies with the transformation of certain problematic files, like `calculator.py`, where incorrect logical implementations and syntax errors exist.\n\nA noteworthy suggestion involves enhancing the edit acceptance criteria in the `incorrect_edit` function to allow for non-exact matches, reducing unnecessary flags during parsing. Additionally, filtering out changes to “prompt” files efficiently is proposed to prevent unintentional edits. Finally, a recommendation to incorporate the `black` library for consistent code formatting across all outputs is made, with potential implications for dependency management. These actionable points aim to streamline code edits, address security through improved error handling, and enhance architectural coherence."

    "summarized_comments": "The PR presents multiple technical issues that need addressing. First, a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'keras_contrib' is encountered during training, indicating that this module is required but not installed on the user's environment. Additionally, a subsequent `SyntaxError` arises due to a missing colon in `show_warped` method definition in `Trainer.py`, which requires correction.\n\nMoreover, the user experiences Out of Memory (OOM) errors during the extraction process, which do not occur on the master branch. This discrepancy may stem from recent code modifications, particularly the potential removal of resize functionality in the extractor, necessitating further investigation.\n\nLastly, there is a `FileNotFoundError` related to missing 'alignments.json' during training, hinting at insufficient validation of input file dependencies. Concrete suggestions include restoring the resize logic and ensuring that required files are created or adequately referenced prior to execution."

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment raises several technical issues and implementation suggestions along with architectural considerations regarding the plugin architecture for a GAN implementation. The current class structure includes Model, Trainer, and a potentially misnamed \"Trainable\" class, and it is suggested to align more closely with the formalism of plugins. \n\nA specific exception during training indicates that the variable `random_transform_args` is not defined due to `ensure_file_exists` creating empty files. As a workaround, it is advised to comment out the `load_weights` lines and ensure files are saved correctly before training to handle the empty file issue.\n\nAnother critical error arises from the `minibatch` function signature where three arguments are passed instead of two. The proposed correction is to modify the `minibatch` function to accept additional parameters for compatibility. Additional errors were noted during training, including mismatches in model weights and reshaping issues, culminating in a ValueError that halts the training process. Further testing and revisions are recommended."

I took reference [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/423379/using-global-variables-in-a-function-other-than-the-one-that-created-them) for the `global`.\r\n\r\nAlso on the thread/process questions, I took what I found in Python, as I'm still beginner in Python, so maybe it is not the right way to go.

Can you tell me if it is ok for you @facepainter ?\r\n\r\n**edit:** I ran 2 tests to test previous version and this one, they seemed to show similar performance, but maybe I did a mistake because, when I run them now, I have better result for previous version. So  maybe this patch is not as fast as the previous one. Let me know if you see differences\n@Clorr\r\n\r\n>   I took reference here for the global.\r\n\r\nAh yeah - that wont work across process at all. \r\nIf you imagine, you can't spawn a process - then have that process do a bunch of stuff in memory on another process (i.e. the one that spawned it), you have to use IPC rather than shared memory when doing such things. \r\n\r\nmulti threading/processing has a bunch of caveats to it - mainly that anything you pass across processes has to be picklable (serialisable). \r\n\r\n(As an aside this is actually where electron/nodejs excels - it is totally built on the asynchronous IPC model - almost enforces it throughout...more my background too).\r\n\r\nWill test now with the thread pool but at a glance that looks good :)\r\n\r\n>I see from your stack that you are using python 3.6, while I'm using 3.5, maybe the behavior have change in between. \r\n\r\nI get same in 3.5/3.6....\r\n\r\nIf it 100% worked for you and you are linux? Then it must be linux/windows os.fork BS. Wouldn't be surprised if global behaves differently here somehow across platform  :(\n@Clorr  yeah that works, threading is the way to do it, much simpler and avoids the memory isolation / pickling issues :) - that is really good in the profiler too, much faster :)\r\n\r\nOOI what are you using to profile/benchmark - i've been using the Python Profiling in Visual Studio 2017  and I'm really impressed. \nlol just RTFM now - https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.dummy\r\n\r\nthere is actually a ThreadPool in multiprocessing.

    "summarized_comments": "This PR highlights a critical `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable` exception when calling `method(item)` inside the `runner` function. The error stems from improper use of global variables across separate processes in `lib/multithreading.py`. Global variables do not share state between processes due to distinct memory spaces, rendering the current implementation unreliable.\n\nIt is suggested to switch to inter-process communication mechanisms like `Queue` or `Pipe` for sharing methods or arguments rather than relying on global state. The reviewer advises using `ThreadPool` from `multiprocessing.dummy` for thread-based parallelism, which can circumvent serialization issues connected to function calls.\n\nAdditionally, implementing thread-safety measures, such as using locks for shared data, is recommended to ensure consistent access to mutable states. Overall, restructuring the approach for process communication is necessary to resolve the observed failures."

    "unsumarized_comments": "Despite that comment in there, for some reason, both the RGB and the BGR versions of the image are still sent to the detector. See current code below. This is unnecessary as the BGR version is redundant and will perform worse than the RGB version. Parring down the loop to use just the RGB version is good practice and should speed things up?  @ iperov Is there a reason not to?\r\n\r\n``\r\ninput_image_bgr = input_image[:,:,::-1].copy() \r\ninput_images = [input_image, input_image_bgr]\r\n \r\n    detected_faces = []\r\n    for current_detector, input_image in ((current_detector, input_image) for current_detector in dlib_detectors for input_image in input_images):\r\n        detected_faces = current_detector(input_image, 0)\nPS - the current code is also mislabeled. As cv2.imread loads all images as BGR, we have to convert it to RGB in order for it to play well with Dlib. At the very least the original code \r\n\r\ninput_image_bgr = input_image[:,:,::-1].copy()\r\n\r\nshould be changed to \r\n\r\ninput_image_rgb = input_image[:,:,::-1].copy()\r\n\r\nas it is incorrect and misleading\nthe ironic thing is that input_image_bgr is actually in RGB format and mislabelled. so unless you run the detector with that file, you get the subpar performance.\n@iperov You can be a bit more cordial, rather than just saying I suxx. I understand that I'm new to this and that you're passionate but I have the same goal as you ....\r\n\r\nI am testing this further by the way. I posted this PR now at this stage for comment and review ( like I thought I was supposed to ? ) I don't understand why you're yelling to close this item when I've tried to logically explain why the code likely doesn't need some extra lines of code and extra calls to the detector to get the same performance/found faces. Sorry if I offended you by editing your implementation but I thought this was the whole point of open source code...?  \r\n\r\nBtw, this was just an intermediate step on my way to vectorizing the whole extract chain as the dlib detector can take vectors of images as inputs and can process them as batches...\nThere is a problem where dlib runs out of memory really easily. So I'm not sure but batch processing could run into that? Keep in mind that the project is supposed to be usable with people with lower end cards.\nThis PR adresses details that are beyond my understanding. What I can see here is that the proposed code is somewhat clean and should be respected. My thinking is:\r\n- If this messes up things completely this should be seen and the PR won't be merged.\r\n- If it highly improves things, this should also be seen and this could be merged.\r\n- If the difference is very low, it does not deserves so much hard discussion, and we can talk about this calmly.\r\n\r\nAlso, @iperov, you should consider that if you say things that are too strong, it will deserve your credibility (although I'm sure you know what you are saying as this was discussed in #233 and it generated the #236 PR). So I'm sure this can be talked about calmly and with proper arguments... \r\n\r\nAt some point #233 offers an interesting test case. As @iperov  showed that his modification have improved things, we should at least test that this PR does not bring regression on that test case. \nYes, however, before #233 we were using BGR only, which is not what CNN or HOG were designed for.  @iperov's change, to use RGB and BGR was helpful.  This PR is just saying that using RGB may have been all that was necessary and that using both RGB and BGR is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nHere is an initial test of my own test data.\r\n\r\nThe command I ran is:\r\npython3 faceswap.py extract -i content/ -o Testdata/bgr/ -j 20\r\nand \r\npython3 faceswap.py extract -i content/ -o Testdata/nobgr/ -j 20\r\n\r\n```\r\nWithout patch:\r\n3271/3271 [21:11<00:00,  2.57it/s]\r\n-------------------------\r\nImages found:        3271\r\nFaces detected:      3271\r\n-------------------------\r\nls Testdata/bgr/ | wc\r\n    965     965   26055\r\nWith patch:\r\n100%| 3271/3271 [18:42<00:00,  2.91it/s]\r\n-------------------------\r\nImages found:        3271\r\nFaces detected:      3271\r\n-------------------------\r\nls Testdata/nobgr/ | wc\r\n    965     965   26055\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe detection was EXACTLY the same.  The exact same number of faces were found and each face was identical.  The folders were identical.  The only difference was in execution time. 21:11 without the patch and 18:42 with the patch.\r\n\r\nObviously, this is not complete.  I didn't test CNN (I don't have GPUs available right now) or a comprehensive set of data (literally impossible), but these results tell me that this PR has some merit, at least for further testing.  But I think it's likely that just using RGB instead of RGB and BGR makes sense.\r\n\r\nNote also that there is currently a bug that says every image has exactly 1 detected face so I actually checked the folder itself.\nTesting with the 1,000 images found in https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/issues/233\r\n\r\nCurrent Master Code:\r\npy faceswap.py extract -i E:\\shots\\testing -o E:\\shots\\testing\\faces_master -D cnn\r\n1.  985 faces found in 1,000 frames   3:52 time --- 4.31 it/s\r\n2.  985 faces found in 1,000 frames   3:53 time --- 4.29 it/s\r\n\r\nProposed PR Code:\r\npy faceswap.py extract -i E:\\shots\\testing -o E:\\shots\\testing\\faces_PR -D cnn\r\n1.  985 faces found in 1,000 frames   3:33 time --- 4.68 it/s\r\n2.  985 faces found in 1,000 frames   3:36 time --- 4.61 it/s\r\n\r\nNo difference in faces. Slight speed increase\nDoing a comparison to 1adrianb and his face_alignment script https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment/blob/master/face_alignment/api.py which @iperov ported to Keras ( see 1adrianb code below )\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_landmarks(self, input_image, all_faces=False):\r\n        if isinstance(input_image, str):\r\n            try:\r\n                image = io.imread(input_image)\r\n            except IOError:\r\n                print(\"error opening file :: \", input_image)\r\n                return None\r\n        else:\r\n            image = input_image\r\n\r\n        detected_faces = self.detect_faces(image)\r\n```\r\nLater on the same image is passed to the get_predictions function (i.e. landmarks )\r\n\r\nHe uses scimage (io.imread) to do the imread of the images. The scimage documentation states that it loads images as RGB format unlike the cv2.imread which loads in BGR format.  If we don't invert the channels before sending the resulting image to the face detector and the landmark predictor, this is an implementation change from 1adrianb. I can evaluate the differences in accuracy if we deviate from that implementation as we currently do, but ....\r\n\r\n@iperov Was it your intention to change this when you ported his code or just an issue due to the cv2.imread and io.imread difference?\r\n\r\n\nTested 10,000 frames from multiple movies containing multiple scenes with differing lighting, zoom levels, poses, and profiles shots.\r\n\r\n**Current Master Code:**\r\npy faceswap.py extract -i E:\\shots\\testing -o E:\\shots\\testing\\faces_master -D cnn\r\n\r\n6,599 faces found in 10,000 frames --- 37:49 time --- 4.41 it/s\r\nmanually sorted through and found 65 false positives\r\n\r\n**Proposed PR Code:**\r\npy faceswap.py extract -i E:\\shots\\testing -o E:\\shots\\testing\\faces_PR -D cnn\r\n\r\n6,656 faces found in 10,000 frames --- 30:22 time --- 5.49 it/s\r\nmanually sorted through and found 75 false positives\r\n\r\nfalse positives are mostly zoomed out shots with a whole person in the frame of the picture.\r\nHaven't evaluated landmark / alignment file yet but assume there will also be minor adjustments as mentioned previously. \r\n\nOk, I ran some tests, and got some fairly unexpected results, to be honest. On the whole I would say that this is a positive change, but I would like to see some more results, because this looks fairly inconclusive to me right now. I can't help but think there may be some other factors at play in my set up, but here they are anyway, run with:\r\n` -D cnn -r on`\r\n\r\n```\r\n                |Time                   |Frames\r\nTitle   Frames  |Old     New    Diff    |Old    New     Diff\r\npsp1    3996    |24:39   22:35   2:04   |3959   3985    26 \r\npsp2    2122    |12:45   19:04  -6:19   |1959   1962    3\r\nplow    4496    |30:43   25:23   5:20   |3903   3904    1 \r\nsb      552     |03:06   03:07  -0:01   |552    552     0\r\n----------------|-----------------------|------------------\r\nTOTAL   11166   |71:13   70:09   1:04   |10373  10403   30\r\n----------------|-----------------------|------------------\r\n```\r\nI'm surprised to see that, for the most part, this appears to detect *more* faces.\r\n\nRegarding the more faces found... the current code will abort the code loop below and not evaluate the RGB image in the detector if \"any\" faces are found in the BGR image. I also found more faces in my test...\r\n```\r\nfor current_detector, input_image in ((current_detector, input_image) for current_detector in dlib_detectors for input_image in input_images):\r\n        detected_faces = current_detector(input_image, 0)\r\n        if len(detected_faces) != 0:\r\n            break\r\n```\r\nPotential scenarios that result in more faces found ( As I strongly suspect the RGB detector is more robust and accurate and 3 people have reported the PR finding more faces, one of the following is likely true )\r\n1. The detector finds a foot in the BGR image and thinks its a face and quits the loop. The RGB detector would have found a foot and a face or just a face.\r\n2. The detector finds a frontal face in the BGR image and quits the loop. The RGB detector would have found a frontal face and a profile face.\r\n3. The detector finds a normal sized face in the BGR image and quits the loop. The RGB detector would have found a normal sized face and a tiny face and a large face.\r\n4. The detector finds a face of Person A in the BGR image and quits the loop. The RGB detector would have found a face of Person A and Person B.\r\n\r\nYou can isolate for this test by flipping the order of the image list from\r\n```\r\ninput_images = [input_image, input_image_bgr]\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\ninput_images = [ input_image_bgr, input_image]\r\n```\r\nOnce again the \"input_image_bgr\" is the image actually in RGB format...\r\n",

Currently, both RGB and BGR versions of images are sent to the detector, which is redundant; using only the RGB version is recommended to enhance performance.

It should be renamed to `input_image_rgb` for clarity.\n\nFurther, it has been noted that the detector currently exits prematurely upon finding a face in the BGR image, potentially missing additional faces detectable in the RGB variant. Testing indicates that eliminating the BGR variant maintained the same face detection accuracy while improving execution time.\n\nAdditionally, the PR highlights potential memory issues with batch processing using dlib, which might hinder performance on lower-end hardware. It is advised to conduct further tests to validate these changes and ensure no regression occurs from these modifications.

I'm probably going to create another branch to merge this into whilst it is tested (I do not possess an M1 Mac, so cannot do much testing myself) and so I can refactor a little bit around the multiple backends that FS will support (also I would prefer not to remove the Nvidia/Apple combo. It is likely to be a very rare use case, but may still be in use by some users).\r\n\r\nRE: models turning white - try lowering the learning rate to see if you can get things training that way. Interesting about Phaze-A... I would expect the StoJo preset to be the one which doesn't work, as the others are mostly just recreations of existing models.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you could fix up the Linting errors, that would be appreciated. Just helps to keep with code consistency. I wouldn't recommend using Black, as it's a bit OTT imho.\r\n\r\nIf you feel up to creating an install script, that would also be appreciated. I understand if not, but it shouldn't be that hard using the linux install script as a base https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/blob/master/.install/linux/faceswap_setup_x64.sh\r\n\r\nOtherwise I will look to review more thoroughly in the coming days.\nYou may want to hold fire on any linting etc. I am going to refactor the GPUstats section for better class inheritance rather than the myriad of if/else statements, and also try to bring that section of code a bit more up to date, as it is now fairly old. It *should* then be fairly trivial to rewrite this code a bit to inherit from the (newly created) base GPUStats class.\n> Hi, I am working it on m1 pro too! But how do you fix the pynvx is not working? @geewiz94\r\n\r\n@CaffreyR It has not been merged into the main branch yet. If you want to test, please make sure that you've checked out this fork: https://github.com/geewiz94/faceswap/tree/patch-1 (switch to branch **patch-1**)\r\n\r\nAnd then follow the install instructions here:\r\nhttps://github.com/geewiz94/faceswap/blob/patch-1/INSTALL.md#macos-apple-silicon-install-guide\n@daniellivingston @geewiz94 Ok, I have refactored gpu_stats into it's own package. This is currently in Staging (which I have changed to point this PR at), but will be in Master after I have performed some final checks.\r\n\r\nThis means that different GPU backends will get dynamically loaded depending on the faceswap backend in use. The unfortunate side effect is that this means you now have conflicts to be resolved. On the plus side it removes the issue of the pynvx dependency, as that will now only be loaded if the backend is Nvidia running on an Apple machine. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, updating you code should not be too difficult. Please use the backend name 'applem1' so that it is easily distinguishable from Apple Intel machines. It should be fairly obvious what needs to be done by overriding the NotImplemented methods from the base GPUStats class, but any problems, let me know.\r\n\r\n\nMerged and tested, seems to be working! Hope the code is okay. I'm not too sure about error handling during Metal initialization.\r\n\r\nI also renamed the backend to 'apple_silicon' since the M1 name is going to be outdated pretty soon when M2 comes out.\n@torzdf I think you're looking for a function like this, for me it outputs `darwin_arm64`: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71551501\r\n\r\nOther ways I've tried:\r\n```\r\n>> platform.machine()\r\narm64\r\n>> platform.processor()\r\narm\r\n>> cpuinfo.get_cpu_info().get('brand_raw')\r\nApple M1 Pro\r\n```\r\nI'm not able to test this on an Intel Mac unfortunately.",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR has several PEP 8 compliance issues across multiple files. Specifically, in `lib/gpu_stats/apple_silicon.py`, there are line length violations (Lines 86 and 113 exceed 99 characters), while `lib/gpu_stats.py` contains an inline comment spacing issue (Line 17). In `lib/metal/__init__.py`, multiple formatting issues such as insufficient blank lines (Lines 3, 6, 14, 20, 28, 29, 38, 40, 43, 46, 49, 52, 56, 59) and a missing newline at EOF (Line 65) are present. It is advised to use the Black formatter, although the reviewer has reservations about its strictness.\n\nThe reviewer plans to create a separate branch for further testing, as they lack access to an M1 Mac. They propose refactoring GPU stats for improved class inheritance. Additionally, there's a suggestion to create an install script based on the existing Linux version, though flexibility is provided regarding this task. Error handling during Metal initialization is also noted as an area of concern. Finally, the backend name has been updated to 'apple_silicon' for relevance."

There are two faces in video.\r\nFaces was extracted in random order such as [0][1][0][1] or [0][1][1][0] \r\nSO will you delete manually second face in 1500 frames ?? \r\nMe not. Its waste of time.\r\nAlso we cannot apply my sorttool https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap/pull/255 for dst video, because its renaming files, then files will not match alignments.json.\r\nSo better is track mask in video editor and cut unwanted faces, or track main face mask and overlay it on original video.\n@bryanlyon that's a good idea, I'll work on that too.\r\n\r\n@iperov I'm pretty comfortable with manually deleting all those bad faces, it gives me peace of mind that my dataset is good since I looked at each individual picture. Also, I never tried it, but I thought there was a face-filter feature here that tries to only extract faces matching an input face you specify. An alternate solution that I've done is with a video editor, cover the unwanted face with a black box. There's probably better programs that can track and blur a face too. As for your tool's renaming of files, maybe you can write your sort tool to also modify the alignments file with the changes it makes so nothing's out of sync. I was thinking of doing a similar sort, but not as a separate tool, as an actual step in extraction. Eventually I wanted to assign a face to 3 categories: left-profile, front, and right-profile. Since this would be done during extraction, we'd know which of the 3 folders the face would be going into and so can write it into the alignments file.\n@iperov as it is the tool you made doesn't work for convert because any faces you delete after sorting will still get patched on convert.\r\n\r\nI am interested in using masks in source video though like you do what video editor would you recommend for this? When i used to use fakeapp i would go over and delete the 1,000s of faces of the other person manually haha\nJust my 2 cents: I think this would be better as a separate tool. In my use case, at least, I do not train on every face discovered in a 25fps+ video, therefore I have no need to keep the extracted faces after generating alignments.json. \r\n\r\nIdeally workflow would be:\r\n\r\n- Extract all frames to generate alignments.json\r\n- Manually delete unwanted faces from extracted faces folder\r\n- Run tool to update alignments.json\r\n- Delete all faces from the now unneeded faces folder\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution requires that faces are kept, when they are no longer required.\r\n\r\nThis is just my opinion for my use case, and either way it would certainly be useful. Motion tracking and masking (as I currently do) can be fiddly! \nAs for it being a separate tool the idea is that you can run it to clean up the actual alignment files. This can be useful not only for convert, but to perform extraction again with different detector or options, and for portability. So you could run the tool without having to do convert.\nSo would the only way to not use this is to have my \"aligned\" folder named something else. Do you or anyone else have an idea of how this affects performance of convert?\r\n\r\nI think the scenario I am thinking more of is like if I have a video of frontal, nicely extracted faces that I don't delete, it is inefficient to verify they exist in the align folder. Specially if it is looking for that folder \"under the hood\".\r\n\r\nI definitely would like hear what others think. And I can run tests to compare performance too. \n@Apollo122 It is not empty it is full of well aligned faces that do not need to be checked. \r\nIt is not created automatically but is what newbies would use and if it is slow it would discourage use. \r\n\r\nI am just raising the issue because I ran this pull request among merges with others and it made my convert time really bad (even without seamless). I cannot say this is the culprit but I wanted to bring it up. For all I know it could have been a bad conflict resolution I made between pulls what caused this, so if it seems negligible to you all I don't want to hold back the merge of the PR. Thanks   ",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR comment raises several concrete technical concerns regarding the extraction and management of face data from videos. A primary issue is the inefficiency in manually deleting extraneous face frames after extraction, especially given random ordering and the potential for high frame counts (e.g., 1500 frames). The inability to utilize the existing sorting tool due to file renaming mismatching the `alignments.json` file is a significant drawback. A recommendation includes leveraging video editor capabilities for face tracking and masking instead of manual deletion. Additionally, a proposal for workflow improvement is noted: extracting frames, manually removing unwanted faces, updating `alignments.json`, and then deleting unnecessary files. The suggestion to create a separate tool for aligning and cleaning up face data is also emphasized to enhance usability. Moreover, concerns about convert performance affecting the workflow efficiency are mentioned, warranting further testing and evaluation."

    "summarized_comments": "The PR comment highlights several critical issues in the multi-threaded implementation of the `convert` function. Notably, the `self.process()` method in the `DirectoryProcessor` class is incorrectly called without passing the required `reader` argument, leading to runtime errors. Additionally, the override in `ExtractTrainingData` is not valid due to the absence of the necessary argument, which raises concerns over method signature consistency and invocation.\n\nThe introduction of the `-j` argument for specifying job numbers is commendable, as it significantly boosts performance; however, the underlying design needs to accommodate potential conflicts with other PRs and maintain compatibility in a multi-threaded context. It is suggested that to avoid merge conflicts, changes should be isolated to the current PR or merged from a personal repo. \n\nFurthermore, issues were observed while executing under Windows using the `multiprocessing` module, clarifying that using `-j 1` could serve as a fallback. The session confirmed that a new helper function for image processing was successfully integrated, simplifying the process and leveraging the `PluginLoader` for face extraction. The need for an OOP refactor was also noted for enhanced maintainability."

I have been using (a fork of) dfaker's repo for a while and I wanted to check this project out. My fork didn't touch the model architecture at all so I figured I could use my weights files on the dfaker model of your branch.\r\n\r\nLet me first say that I love the refactor done in this branch! When I last checked out master a few months ago I quickly gave up. Thanks for all that work.\r\n\r\nThat said, I did ran into some issues:\r\n1. `dfaker` model is no longer compatible with \"legacy dfaker\" model. @kvrooman made some changes to the nn_blocks which caused this (listed below). Do we want to keep compatibility with legacy models (I would like that)? I assume the changes to the model are made with good reason, so should we then have a model 'dfaker original' and another 'dfaker kvrooman' for example?\r\n2. At first I did not enable previews and to whole thing ran very slowly. Later when I realized that it would run at a normal speed when previews were enabled I may have found the cause for the slowness: `monitor_console` has a tight while loop without any sleep at all. This may eat up resources unnecessarily. I haven't confirmed though, if I do I'll follow up on that.  (could be related to `[Postponed - minor issue] Training takes a long time to start?`)\r\n3. This is not a big issue, but I was wondering if it would be at all possible to write a converter for dfaker's `alignment.json` format to the format used by this project? I took a quick look and I saw there is one converter for `deepfacelabs` format.\r\n4. While I haven't done proper investigation, it looks like the image processing in the training data acquiring process/thread is not fast enough to keep a single 1080ti busy. Whatever the cause, the GPU is not fully utilized (it get to about 30 to 40%). Original dfakers project wasn't able to exhaust the GPU resources either, but there it was able to keep it at about 80% (on this same hardware configuration) CPU is a i7 3770, disk is fast and does not appear to be a bottleneck. CPU is not 100% utilized, is there a way to spawn more python processes to parallelise the training data processing? \r\n\r\nRegarding the model changes (from point 1), listing changes I changed back to make the model compatible again:\r\n\r\n   * There now is a `res_block_follows` param to `upscale`, when it is true the `LeakyReLU` gets added in the `res_block`. However upscale does add a `PixelShuffler`. This thus result in a reversed order of these layers compared to the original model. ie orginal upscale `conv2d -> leaky_re_lu -> pixel_shuffler`, model in this branch `conv2d -> pixel_shuffler -> leaky_re_lu ` (c9d669835ba6cc6941a3f50548c066026d3b10ab)\r\n   * With change to `LeakyReLU` from `upscale` to `res_block`, the alpha changed from 0.1 to 0.2. (c9d669835ba6cc6941a3f50548c066026d3b10ab)\r\n   * Added a `Scale` layer (62f2b6f5fac1861e70d86e1e30abf60e9b1bfba1)\r\n   * Removal of Bias in res_block's conv2d layers (268ccf298aec9cc03f3e6325f23127243ce3f0c9)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nI've only started looking into this codebase today, so I apologize if I missed anything and I don't want to step on anyone's toes here, just wanting to share some thoughts while I have them.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts, thanks!\r\n \nThanks for the feedback! To answer some of your points.\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world dfaker would be model compatible with the original @dfaker model. My main goal was to keep it as 'vanilla' as possible, whilst extending functionality where possible. The main purpose of this refactor is to standardize as much as possible, and make any resource used in one model available for all existing models and any new models. Unfortunately some of those ideals don't necessarily play nicely with each other, so I will always choose to move towards standardized beyond maintaining custom compatibility. That said @kvrooman would be better placed to comment on the reasoning behind the changes to the nn_blocks. \r\n\r\nWhen you say legacy dfaker? Do you mean earlier versions in this branch? If so, unfortunately we won't maintain backwards compatibility. Anything and everything in this branch is subject to change until it gets merged to staging (hopefully very soon).\r\n\r\nWhilst \"While True\" loops aren't particularly great practice, they also don't generally eat too many CPU cycles, so it shouldn't be too much of an issue here. There is definitely an issue with the feeders, and the plan is to move A and B into their own processes, as everything is competing for single threaded CPU time at the moment. I have also noticed that dfaker feeds particularly slowly, and I will investigate why. I've decided to put it on the backburner for now as, whilst it isn't great, it isn't model breaking, and moving to multiprocesses is likely to involve a fairly hefty rewrite to keep everything thread-safe. It is high on the list once we've got this migrated into master though.\r\n\r\nI will look into the possibility of adding a converter for dfaker's alignments files.\r\n\r\n\nThanks for the answers, that clears up some things I was wondering.\r\n\r\nWhere I said \"legacy dfaker\" I was referring to the models defined in the original [df](github.com/dfaker/df/blob/master/model.py) repo. I have quite some weights files that match this model, which I would love to re-use with this project. They have many hours of training in them and in my experience it works quite well to re-use existing weights from decoders as a crude form of transfer learning.\r\n\r\nRegarding the required resources for the dfaker feeder, if it is similar to the original dfaker code with its warping and matching of similar landmarks I can imagine it would be slower than others. I understand this gets a lower priority compared to getting this merged into master. In the mean time I will dig into this part of the code base and see if is either some low hanging fruit or if I can start getting the feeding multiprocess, at the very least get an idea on what needs to be done there.\r\n\r\nThanks!\nsome notes on the items you highlighted. \r\n\r\nthere was a focus on improving performance & better stability for models, especially when some training instability errors crept up. I generally applied some typical practices in resnet models to our code. realize this may make some back compatability issues with legacy models. you could use a weight loader to load your old weights in the updated model arch. as the layers are still all the same. we don't do this is our code, but I've done it myself for other models\r\n\r\n---There now is a res_block_follows param to upscale, when it is true the LeakyReLU gets moved into in the res_block. However upscale does add a PixelShuffler. This thus result in a reversed order of these layers compared to the original model. ie orginal upscale conv2d -> leaky_re_lu -> pixel_shuffler, model in this branch conv2d -> pixel_shuffler -> leaky_re_lu (c9d6698)\r\n - multiplying by a constant ( as in RELU ) and then reshaping vs. reshaping with the same method and then multiplying by the same constant won't change any values. the order of operations won't affect the result as Pixel shuffler is just a fancy reshape function and involves no math. advantage is better flow through the res_block with a pre-activation style residual.\r\n\r\n---With change to LeakyReLU from upscale to res_block, the alpha changed from 0.1 to 0.2. (c9d6698)\r\n- ideally the alpha of the leaky Relu should be the same throughout the whole model and be fine-tuned...i.e. is .105 better than .10. that being said, the current code base uses .1 and .2 in the res block. I left the res block alpha as it was, but we can at least keep the first pre-activation relu as the same .1, and consider moving the rest to .1 as well\r\n---Added a Scale layer (62f2b6f)\r\n- this was related to stability issues in some models where they would have exploding gradients. adding a learnable scale layer with the multiplier initially set at zero or a small value helps with stability and speed of training the preceding residual block. old model's weights in the residual block would have internally learned this scaling factor\r\n\r\n---Removal of Bias=False in res_block's conv2d layers\r\n- traditionally, residual blocks will always use Batch Normalization after the convolution. BN has a bias adder internally so the bias in the preceding convolution is usually removed as superfluous to speed up calculation. we don't use BN as it worsens / stops the identity swapping, so adding the bias back in to the conv adds more expressive power as seen in every other convolution in the model\nThanks for the explanations on the these changes, makes a lot of sense now.\r\n\r\nI am interested in the loading of weights into a different model arch. There already is a `convert_legacy_weights` function in place which uses `load_weights`. From what I read in the docs one could pass `by_name`: \r\n\r\n> By default, the architecture is expected to be unchanged. To load weights into a different architecture (with some layers in common), use by_name=True to load only those layers with the same name.\r\n\r\nbut that will not work because the layer names are not only different, layers with the same name are used in different places. ie a `conv2d_10` in the new model is in a different location than the `conv2d_10` of the old model. Do you have any suggestion on how to approach this?\r\n\r\nWould I need to make a mapping between old names and new names of corresponding layers and the `layer.set_weights` each layer individually?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

    "summarized_comments": "The PR highlighted several significant technical concerns with the dfaker model:\n\n1. **Model Compatibility**: The refactor has rendered the dfaker model incompatible with legacy versions, raising the question of whether to maintain compatibility or establish distinct model versions (e.g., 'dfaker original' vs. 'dfaker kvrooman'). The decision was made not to focus on backwards compatibility, prioritizing standardization instead.\n\n2. **Performance Issues**: Concerns about resource constraints were noted, particularly regarding a tight `while` loop in `monitor_console`, potentially hindering performance. An emphasis on migrating the data processing to multiprocess environments was suggested to improve CPU utilization.\n\n3. **Normalization**: A recommendation was made to incorporate normalization into the configuration or the model directly, with a specific code suggestion.\n\n4. **Layer Adjustments**: Changes made to the model architecture (e.g., `res_block_follows` parameter affecting layer order and LeakyReLU adjustments) were identified, with suggestions for uniformity in activation values across the model and inclusion of a converter for legacy alignment formats posed as a potential enhancement. \n\n5. **Weights Loading**: For legacy weight use, a mapping strategy was advised due to differing layer names and positions across model architectures, seeking a method to facilitate compatibility without extensive rewrites.\n\nOverall, this feedback emphasizes the need for tighter architectural considerations and performance optimizations within the dfaker model framework."

    "unsumarized_comments": "Hey @sigmavirus24 . FYI: We have started to discuss this in LEGAL JIRA of the Apache Software Foundation. Seems that in the ASF we have now ~50 projects that are using requests library and the discussion came to the conclusion that basically we have to migrate out of the requests library because of the `chardet`  dependency.\r\n\r\nHere is the discussion:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-572\r\n \r\nWe are discussing about the solution. Forking requests and asking others to use the fork is one thing.\r\n\r\nOne more thing that came out in the discussion is to propose you to donate `requests` to the ASF (and go through incubation process). I believe if you have problems with feature-freeze/maintenance effort needed, becoming part of an established organisation might be a path you might be willing to take. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Would you be willing to  have a second thought about getting rid of the LGPL dependency and merging the PR ? I think we are really close to start a bigger effort of not only converting 50 ASF projects but also asking a number of 3rd-party libraries to switch to our non-LGPL depending fork that we are planning to make.\r\n\r\nWe really want to play it nicely, please don't treat it as a hostile move, but I think we have no other choice here. \n>  How much would it cost to answer that in the beginning? How much PR would be closed already if there were fewer non-said things? This debate could have been avoided in the first place, It appears that maintainers already made their decision the second that PR showed up.\r\n\r\nContrary to the story you seem to have constructed about my opinion (and only mine, I don't speak for Nate), I was keeping an open mind that someone would say \"We did these tests to verify this library is easily swapped for chardet, we think this is safe as an alternative\". The whole conversation hasn't been about backwards compatibility but instead about a license which has been present since before Requests 1.0.\r\n\r\n> You said that 'requests' is SO critical that no sudden changes are tolerated YET chardet 4.0 was used in less time than you answering a hard NO to this. How did maintainers verify that the new release was safe? But denying idna latest major.\r\n\r\nchardet has had consistently top-notch quality releases. It's much like we upgrade urllib3 pretty quickly. I feel like I'm missing something in this conversation though since you seem very hung up on this. 4.0, to the best of my knowledge (which is likely incomplete) didn't cause any issues. Dropping Python 2 will get us onto the latest idna but once again, no one has done any testing to indicate that they've found it to have backwards compatibility. Like this PR, folks just send it and expect it to get merged or expect us to do that testing ourselves. If we were to write that kind of testing into our CI, we'd get low quality bug reports from linux distro maintainers about those tests talking to the open internet or even worse, failing as they package incompatible versions together. Just smashing merge doesn't save us any time and only irritates users who are broken by those changes.\r\n\r\n> That is AN opinion, feel free to check out actual facts.\r\n\r\nI'm genuinely confused by this. Are you arguing that the automatic character detection works well? I have years of issues, stackoverflow questions, emails, and blog posts indicating that it's terrible for a great number of people. Maybe not 100% of users, but without any kind of telemetry I can only look at the data available to me and make the determination that users are liable to be less confused by Requests' behaviour if something like chardet wasn't used. That's also orthogonal to the only concern the ASF seems to have which is the license.\r\n\r\n\nText is not a good form of exchange, with too much incomprehension.\r\n\r\n> Contrary to the story you seem to have constructed about my opinion (and only mine, I don't speak for Nate), I was keeping an open mind.\r\n\r\nI don't doubt your good intentions. What I am saying today is that something could have been handled in a better way. Many things you oppose to this PR are stated as things that could have been saying earlier. Not admitting that is not the way to go I think.\r\n\r\n> chardet has had consistently top-notch quality releases.\r\n\r\nComparing chardet to urllib3 is a bit of a stretch. Many open-source programs are well released. Ok for urllib3 but not chardet, I have studied the code and it does not answer the \"top quality\" safe content.\r\nurllib3 release-process is in fact a well-oiled machine.\r\n\r\n> didn't cause any issues.\r\n\r\nFuture tense. Took the risk and waited. Could have been a disaster. As you said, I hung on that. The release calendar is abrupt. This is reasonable to raise the question.\r\n\r\n> Like this PR, folks just send it and expect it to get merged or expect us to do that testing ourselves.\r\n\r\nI think one of the main issues is your feeling regarding those PRs. A contribution could be meet halfway, if you wish nothing to be done to your end, that okay. Be a mentor, guide them. Let them do the actual work, share your knowledge, expand your horizon with them. If you wish to be a solo reviewer/merger, that okay for everyone.\r\n\r\n> Just smashing merge doesn't save us any time and only irritates users who are broken by those changes.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that and agrees with it. You saw in people's message only that. But let me assure you that it wasn't just about that.\r\n\r\n> Are you arguing that the automatic character detection works well?\r\n\r\nNo, never said that. Some solution brings more stability than other for sure. Chardet is far behind cchardet/uchardet, should be completely blind to not see it. I am as well placed as you to answer things on this matter.\r\n\r\n> but without any kind of telemetry I can only look at the data available to me\r\n\r\nYou really need to make some more research. There is more data than \"what you have\". You would know it if you looked at what was made. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I insist that if you opened up earlier. No one would have insisted for weeks...\r\n\r\n>  but instead about a license which has been present since before Requests 1.0.\r\n\r\nYes, this is true. But alternatives were not there until recently and would have been ridiculous to propose it sooner. Needed more time to gain maturity across usage. cchardet excluded due to binding/build constraint.\r\n\r\nRegards,\nI will try to run more tests tomorrow with more sites.\r\n\r\nJust for @sigmavirus24 and others who read that - so that you was aware why it is important for us and what is the problem we are trying to address. Maybe you simply are not aware what is the extent of the problem.\r\n\r\nFor Airflow - we are just about to release 2.1, and I just finished the PR (took me more than a day) where I removed requests as core dependency (basically we replaced `requests` with `httpx`, we vendored-in `connexion` (we have API build with `connexion`) and replaced requests with `httpx` for it) and changed HTTP provider (and it's derived classes) to use `httpx`. Here is the PR: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/15781 . This PR still needs to be reviewed, corrected after review thoroughly tested and merged. This is a monster change: 86 files, +7,035 −684  lines of code.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-05-11 21-51-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/595491/117875937-0a784680-b2a3-11eb-97c7-2c6acd48e2c2.png)\r\n\r\nBut as PMC of Airflow we have no choice now -  we are obliged to do it to release new version (now that we are aware of the problem with `chardet` it would be conscious violating the policy of ASF if we keep `chardet` as mandatory requirement). \r\n\r\nLuckily we could do it rather \"quickly\" because we've already split airflow into core and optional parts and this OK with the policy of ASF to have optional dependency on LGPL. But we cannot have mandatory one.\r\n\r\nBut this does not even touch all the optional dependencies and transitive ones. We have 43 3rd-party packages that use requests (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-572?focusedCommentId=17341767&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17341767)  where requests is used (GCP/Azure/Docker/Kubernetes - they are optional but it's hard to imagine anyone using Airflow withou tthose).\r\n\r\nUnfotunately some other projects of ASF are using Airflow as dependency (for example [Apache Liminal](https://incubator.apache.org/clutch/liminal.html) and they require docker, Kubernetes optional parts of Airflfow. So they are in much worse situation - because for them pretty much a chain of dependencies would have to be updated. So for now Liminal is pretty much blocked.\r\n\r\nThose ~50 projects of ASF could either do the same as I just did, or test requests with `charset_normalizer` when it is ready for testing in alpha/beta. \nHi,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I would like to thanks @sigmavirus24 \r\n\r\nThen @ashb \r\nI created two tests playground using docker-compose with python 2.7 and 3.8 using your branch. Sources available at https://github.com/Ousret/requests-x-charset_normalizer\r\n\r\nThe results are also fairly positives. The remaining only problem is that you missed filtering out the warning about \"trying to detect from..\" as did @da1910 \r\n\r\nHere are what I got from running `playground27` and `playground38`. (Diff only)\r\n\r\nI took into account that `ISO-8859-7` == `cp1253`, as it is the same code page under a different name.\r\n\r\nWe have a firm **78 %** backward compatibility exact results.

    "sumarized_length": 1155,
    "summarized_comments": "The ongoing discussion in the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) surrounding the `requests` library highlights concerns over its `chardet` dependency, particularly regarding licensing issues tied to LGPL. Given that approximately 50 ASF projects utilize the library, there's a proposal for either migrating away from `requests` or forking it to eliminate this dependency. \n\nTo address these issues, it’s suggested that the `requests` library consider donation to ASF, potentially easing maintenance burdens and opening pathways for broader community support. The dialogue emphasizes the need for thorough testing to validate backward compatibility, especially with `charset_normalizer` as a potential substitute for `chardet`. \n\nCurrent testing suggests promising results with a 78%+ compatibility rate based on various encoding samples, although some exceptions persist that need addressing. Any integration should prioritize maintaining API stability to avoid introducing breaking changes that could frustrate users. Developers are encouraged to perform early testing and share findings to expedite the review process and collaboratively address concerns."

I've cut 3.6.0 for pipenv, so this issue should be fixed if you want to rebase or push another commit.\r\n\r\nThere are a few more errors when you get past the pipenv failure that I haven't had time to fully investigate. From a cursory glance though, this is what I've found so far.\r\n\r\n * 2.6 needs to be removed from the test list for appveyor.\r\n * `win_inet_pton` appears to be a requirement for PySocks to run in Python 2.X on Windows.\r\n * The `test_time_elapsed_blank` was failing with what appeared to be a division rounding issue, but my latest builds this morning aren't producing this. Something to keep an eye out for though.\nHrm. Sadly, using `time.time()` also doesn't fix the problem on Windows: the two timestamps remain the same. I think it's possible that we cannot get an appropriately accurate clock on a Windows machine for this test to run as expected.\nProbably shouldn't rely on `time.clock` as it's been [deprecated](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.clock) since 3.3.\r\nIs it valid to use `time.perf_counter` when available in this context?\n@nateprewitt Is it possible to declare a conditional dependency in a Pipfile?\n@Lukasa I was thinking about that last week with the pton dependency requirement. We don't currently have a way to handle something like that, but from what I can tell neither does pip without conditional code in setup.py.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we define the list used for `socks` in `extras_require` earlier and then append `win_inet_pton`  if `platform.system()` is Windows? That should work consistently for users without any syntax changes, and pipenv already uses `extras_requires` from setup.py.\nI think pip can do it fine with markers. I tried to add something in 63e5b80a6b1b386f9f43ac07948306d0fa2d333b but have yet to test it live: will do so shortly. @dstufft, am I right in assuming that I can add a marker that says \"if you do `pip install requests[socks]` on Windows, install this other dependency?\"\r\n\r\n@nateprewitt Adding dependencies in code in `setup.py` is almost always a bad idea, because wheels don't execute `setup.py`. That means whether or not users get the Windows dependency boils down to the system on which the wheel was built: that is, if I build the wheel on my Mac then no-one gets the Windows dep, while if I build it on my Windows box *everyone* does. That's not really a winning strategy. =)\n@Lukasa, sorry I should have had my coffee before replying to this. This is probably what you were referencing in your original question, but we aren't installing anything from setup.py in the current Makefile.\r\n\r\nSince we can't declare a conditional dependency in Pipfile, this will either need to be handled in the Makefile or appveyor.yml, rather than setup.py. It seems pretty kludgy to shove the conditional into `init`, but `make` should give you what you need to run the test suite. appveyor.yml would fix the testing on our end, but probably result in tickets complaining about tests not working locally on Windows.\nHrm.\r\n\r\nWell, in the first instance we should consider this a feature request for conditional dependencies in Pipfile. I've used them a bit in Python, they're a fairly useful feature, so Pipfile should probably aim to support it at some point. :wink:\r\n\r\nDoing this in the Makefile is gonna suck, so for now we'll do it in appveyor.yml.",

There is an ongoing discussion about using `time.perf_counter` to handle precision timing issues on Windows, as `time.clock` has been deprecated.\n\nA proposal for implementing conditional dependencies in the `Pipfile` was raised but cannot be directly supported.

    "unsumarized_comments": "Hello,\nI can understand how @lukasa is annoyed by unvendoring made downstream, but I can also understand why this is done. For example, in Debian, Python SSLv3 support was removed and I only had to patch (I forwared my patch upstream of course[¹]) urllib3 to fix all packages depending on urllib3.\n\nSo, yes, this is a downstream problem, but as in past (even when this issue arosed on Debian Bug Tracker) I will never add something without asking first if you, upstream developers, are ok with a downstream change. \n As I said a lot of time before being the Debian maintainer of requests I'm one of its users: I want requests to be in the best shape in Debian. :)\n\nI agree with @dstufft and @sigmavirus24 but, if you don't agree, I can also replace the currently used patch in Debian with this so, at least, Debian, Ubuntu and pip will use the same code.\nIMHO cooperating we will arrive to the best solution for all.\n\n[¹] http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/python-modules/packages/python-urllib3/tags/1.9.1-3/debian/patches/06_do-not-make-SSLv3-mandatory.patch?view=markup Yes, next time I will use a PR, fortunately @dstufft forwarded it properly! :)\n\n@eriolv question: Since the symlink is in place (it may just be Fedora that has this in place), is there any chance of the imports that import from `.packages` inside of requests could not be rewritten? \n\nIf not, can the imports not be rewritten after we ship this patch? (After we've updated it to give proper attribution to @dstufft and pypa/pip) The crux of this issue is that sys.modules is incorrectly populated and needs to work a certain way for users to not run into surprises like this.\n\n[/Edit - I submitted my comment too soon]\nAnd I appreciate your collaboration @eriolv. That's why I pinged you immediately. I wanted to make you aware of this from the start and get your feedback as well as @Lukasa's and @ralphbean's\n\nYou don't need to rewrite imports with either the symlinks or this solution. The major difference between symlinks and this solution is. With symlinks the import system is going to see `urllib3` and `requests.packages.urllib3` as two different things. With this it should treat them as the same because it's just aliases the exact same module object in `sys.modules`. This _should_ mean, though I don't think I tested it, that it doesn't matter if people import from `urllib3` or `requests.packages.urllib3`.\n\nMy snarkiness was mostly the result of me waking up late and being late for work and having not had coffee, apologies all.\n\nIn reality I'm +0 on this. I don't like that we have to do it, and the unvendoring zealots have hardened my opinion towards the idea of doing them any favours on any issue whatsoever. (I don't include you in that group @eriolv, you have not displayed any zealotry that I'm aware of :wink: )\n\nHowever, I acknowledge the Catch-22 of the fact that _we_ will get blamed for the zealots decision to unbundle us breaking their code. For that reason I have no intention of blocking this patch: punishing users is unacceptable.\n\nHowever, I'd like _someone_ to test the change, as neither @sigmavirus24 nor @dstufft appear to have. Ideally I'd like some form of automated testing for it as well: having that would raise me to +0.5.\n\nTo be clear, I tested it in the context of pip :) I have not tested it in the context of requests. The major difference being that pip's bundled stuff isn't generally imported outside of pip. In pip we also modify the `setup.py` so there is an environment variable that downstream can set to unbundle things without patching which raises a warning saying that it's an unsupported mechanism for installing pip. We then use this to install pip unbundled and run all of our tests in CI with installed copies of everything. However a difference between pip and requests in this is that pip will only bundle a released copy of something and we also have a vendor.txt which is a file in the requirements.txt file format which lists the exact versions we've bundled. So we can easily install the required things by just doing `pip install -r pip/_vendor/vendor.txt`.\n\nTo be more clear! I know that this will make it so that `import requests.packages.urllib3` will fall back to `import urllib3` automatically without doing an import writes. The thing I haven't tested is that you can do something like:\n\n``` python\nimport requests.packages.urllib3``\nimport urllib3\n\nassert isinstance(urllib3.Timeout, requests.packages.urllib3.Timeout)\n```\n\nSo I did the following:\n\n```\n$ mktmpenv -ppython{{version}}\n$ pip install /path/to/requests/  # Where this is the git repo checked out on this branch\n$ cd lib/python{{version}}/site-packages/requests/packages/\n$ rm -rf chardet urllib3\n$ cd - # Back in the temporary virtualenv directory\n$ pip install chardet urllib3\n$ python\n```\n\nThen at the console I did\n\n``` py\n>>> import requests\n>>> requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get')\n<Response [200]>\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.modules['requests.packages.urllib3']\n<module 'urllib3' from '/Users/ian7708/virtualenv/tmp-421360116860cb19/lib/python2.7/site-packages/urllib3/__init__.pyc'>\n>>> import urllib3\n>>> sys.modules['requests.packages.urllib3'] is urllib3\nTrue\n```\n\nSo we're getting the right module and it has the right name. I'm forgetting though, were there other things we need to check?\n\n``` py\n>>> isinstance(urllib3.Timeout(5), requests.packages.urllib3.Timeout)\nTrue\n```\n",

(If there's no action to take then perhaps the exception should be handled somewhere else (or not thrown at all).) It's up to Kenneth and Cory if they like it as is. I have no strenuous objections to it, I just have a bit of a pet peeve about this particular style.\n\nIn addition to #1939, I believe this also fixes #1952 (which I just filed - sorry about that).\n\n@schlamar Could you please add some test cases for these bugs as well?  A test case for #1952 can be dug out of the (now-scrapped) pull request #1919.\n\n@sigmavirus24 Regarding \"`except RuntimeError: pass # already decoded`\", I sympathize with your \"should this exception have been thrown at all?\" reaction, but it makes sense for `Response.content` to throw an exception when all the content has already been consumed; it happens that in this case we don't care since we are only accessing `.content` for its side effects.  (Would it make you more comfortable if a more specific exception were thrown?)\n\n> Could you please add some test cases for these bugs as well?\n\nVery interesting. I guess this should be possible (while a test case for the original issue is actually hard, we would need a misbehaving web service for that).\n\n> should this exception have been thrown at all\n\nI don't think this was his point. I guess you mixed two things together. My interpretation of @sigmavirus24 comments is:\n1. Instead of a RuntimeError there should be a more explicit exception if the content is already consumed\n2. Don't handle the RuntimeError separately in resolve_redirects, just do a `r.raw.read(...)` in all exception cases.\n\nHere's the test case for #1952 (from #1919).  Add to the big `RequestsTestCase` class in `test_requests.py`.\n\n```\n    def test_manual_redirect_with_partial_body_read(self):\n        s = requests.Session()\n        r1 = s.get(httpbin('redirect/2'), allow_redirects=False, stream=True)\n        assert r1.is_redirect\n        rg = s.resolve_redirects(r1, r1.request, stream=True)\n\n        # read only the first eight bytes of the response body,\n        # then follow the redirect\n        r1.iter_content(8)\n        r2 = next(rg)\n        assert r2.is_redirect\n\n        # read all of the response via iter_content,\n        # then follow the redirect\n        for _ in r2.iter_content(): pass\n        r3 = next(rg)\n        assert not r3.is_redirect\n```\n\nI agree #1939 is not feasible to test without adding stuff to httpbin.  Maybe that should wait for #1166? A bunch of the other redirection bugs I just filed (and more to come) are going to be hard to test without adding stuff to httpbin, too.\n\n> My interpretation of @sigmavirus24 comments _[snip]_\n\nYour interpretation is correct. I've discussed this with several (far more experienced and knowledgeable Python developers, including core PyPy and CPython developers). `RuntimeError` exceptions should never be raised by any library ever. Yes they're there but that does not mean you should use them.\n\nThis also works with your overall goal @zackw: If the error were instead a child of a `RequestException` we could name it well and have:\n\n``` python\ntry:\n    requests.get(...)\nexcept requests.RequestException:\n    #...\n```\n\nWork in every case. In the redirect case, before this PR, it wouldn't. I know that there are several ideas of \"good\" Python code that I disagree with others on (including Kenneth), so I don't push those issues normally.\n\nI haven't found a good way to preserve backwards compatibility though for those catching the RuntimeError and allowing for a RequestException. I don't think creating a new one that inherits from both is a good idea in the slightest. I'd love if either of you had the solution. In fact, I'd probably send you :cake: :)\n\nWhile this is really interesting (never thought about how you would handle backwards compatibility when changing an exception type), it is actually a bit off topic here =) I think we should focus on this PR and maybe move this discussion into a new issue?\n\nPoints standing out:\n- Should I remove handling `RuntimeError` separately (I'm +0 on this)?\n- How to test against the original issue (#1939)? Would a `gzipped_redirect` on httpbin a valid option? I don't know how Kenneth feels about such a \"feature\"...\n\n@sigmavirus24 Should I change \n\n```\ntry:\n    resp.content  # Consume socket so it can be released\nexcept (ChunkedEncodingError, ContentDecodingError):\n    resp.raw.read(decode_content=False)\nexcept RuntimeError:\n    pass  # already consumed\n```\n\nto\n\n```\ntry:\n    resp.content  # Consume socket so it can be released\nexcept (ChunkedEncodingError, ContentDecodingError, RuntimeError):\n    resp.raw.read(decode_content=False)\n```\n\n> I prefer to do something as opposed to using pass in an except block. \n\n@sigmavirus24 I guess you'll like the new [`contextlib.suppress`](http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress) in Python 3.4. =)\n",

    "summarized_comments": "This PR raises several specific concerns regarding the handling of `RuntimeError` and exception management within the `resolve_redirects` method. The comment highlights that attempting to read from the response after a `RuntimeError`—which indicates that the content has already been consumed—is illogical. Instead of using a simple `pass`, the reviewer advocates for an `except` clause that performs an explicit action or suggests altering the exception type thrown, preferably redefining `RuntimeError` to a subclass of `RequestException` for clarity.\n\nAdditionally, there's an actionable request for test cases to cover bugs #1952 and #1939, specifically referencing a test case from a scrapped PR (#1919) for guidance. The overarching theme is to avoid the `RuntimeError` handling separately, to maintain readability, and to explore backwards compatibility while refactoring. Concrete suggestions include modifying exception handling to incorporate `RuntimeError` into a broader exception catch or using `contextlib.suppress` for cleaner syntax."

Also, when would a system package every be preferable to using pip, especially across multiple versions?\n- System packages cannot be used under virtualenvs so they're useless there.\n- Arch seems to only support python 2, so much for all the work that goes into compatibility towards python 3\n- Package maintainers occasionally make their own changes without reporting them upstream\n  - this begs the question, why should we support a decision we didn't make?\n- Package maintainers are occasionally required to use options, e.g., `--optimize=1`, that put the pressure on us to revert explicit design decisions\n  - Following arbitrary guidelines will only lead to insanity, tracking them to further insanity.\n  - Why follow arbitrarily decided guidelines when we have a package manager that works perfectly for us?\n\nLet's put this another way.\n\nIf you want to package Requests for anything other than `pip` or `easy_install`, you're essentially forking it.

Maybe this is out of scope for this PR, let me know if I should handle it separately.\n\n@cdunklau I also noticed that `CaseInsensitiveDict` wasn't caught at any place that checked `isinstance( ... , dict)`, so I altered all of those checks to use `collections.Mapping` instead.  As for the sequence check, that looks ok to me as well, happy to integrate it in this PR, but for now I haven't included it.\n\nGood point. I _really_ dislike the explicit type checks for bool and int. And we really don't need the check for string, I suspect. How about something more like this:\n\n``` python\ndef to_key_val_list(value):\n    if value is None:\n        return None\n\n    if isinstance(value, collections.Mapping):\n        try:\n            # Check for MultiDict first\n            items = value.items(multi=True)\n        except TypeError:\n            items = value.items()\n    elif isinstance(value, collections.Iterable):\n        items = value\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('Value must be a mapping, or iterable of 2-tuples')\n\n    return list((k, v) for k, v in items)\n```\n\nI would think it reasonable to assume that `.items()` was a list, so perhaps something more like:\n\n``` python\ndef to_key_val_list(value):\n    if value is None:\n        return None\n\n    if isinstance(value, collections.Mapping):\n        try:\n            # Check for MultiDict first\n            items = value.items(multi=True)\n        except TypeError:\n            items = value.items()\n    elif isinstance(value, collections.Iterable):\n        items = [(k, v) for k, v in value]\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('Value must be a mapping, or iterable of 2-tuples')\n\n    return items\n```\n\nI'm guessing you are using the generator in list here to catch the 2-tuples?\n\nEDIT:  I suppose we can use a list comprehension, rather than `list()`\n\nHmm, I don't like that `.update` _adds_ items. Shouldn't it overwrite them, like `__setitem__` does? I know that's not how werkzeug's multidict does it, but I think this one should.\n\nThere should definitely be an `.update`-like method that uses `__setitem__` instead of `add`.\n\nDiscussed a bit more with @cdunklau on IRC, we are thinking that keys from arguments in a request should still continue to override the same keys (rather than add more of those keys) from the session param.\n\nStill not sure if there should be some way to specifically add to the existing session keys for a given request, maybe if the request argument is explicitly a multidict.\n\nOther opinions are certainly needed, as I'm not sure if I'm considering all use cases. I'm thinking though that the most common would be to want to override a session key rather than add a second same key to a dict.\n\nI agree with @gazpachoking and @cdunklau, overriding already set keys is the way to go. Sadly, that'll need special-case code.\n\nWhat was the solution to this? I'm trying to use\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\n\r\nfrom werkzeug.datastructures import ImmutableMultiDict\r\n\r\nparams = ImmutableMultiDict([('q1', 'value1'), ('q1', 'value2')])\r\nrequest = requests.Request(method='GET', url='https://my-url.com' params=params)\r\nsession = requests.Session()\r\nprepared_request = request.prepare()\r\n\r\n# getting \"https://my-url.com?q1=value1\",\r\n# but expecting \"https://my-url.com?q1=value1\"&q1=value2\"\r\nprint(prepared_request.url)\r\n\r\nresponse = session.send(prepared_request)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Update**:\r\n\r\nSolved by removing ImmutableMultiDict. This works:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\n\r\nparams = [('q1', 'value1'), ('q1', 'value2')]\r\nrequest = requests.Request(method='GET', url='https://my-url.com' params=params)\r\nsession = requests.Session()\r\nprepared_request = request.prepare()\r\n\r\n# \"https://my-url.com?q1=value1\"&q1=value2\"\r\nprint(prepared_request.url)\r\n\r\nresponse = session.send(prepared_request)\r\n```",
    "sumarized_length": 945,
    "summarized_comments": "The PR raises several technical issues regarding the `to_key_val_list` implementation. It fails with non-dictionary mappings like `CaseInsensitiveDict` and does not handle sequences containing items of length different from 2 efficiently. The suggestion includes adopting `collections.Mapping` for type checks to enhance compatibility. The current implementation also explicitly checks against `bool` and `int`, which is unnecessary, and it should use a more generic `collections.Iterable` instead. \n\nThere's a proposal to overhaul the method to directly return items in list comprehension rather than enforcing that they be a list. Furthermore, the handling of an `.update` method is debated, suggesting that it should overwrite existing keys instead of adding duplicates, which is contrary to typical MultiDict behavior. The interactions imply ongoing discussions on additional methodologies for handling session keys versus request arguments."
