The code looks well-structured with comprehensive implementation across both frontend and backend components.\n\nBefore this PR can be merged, there are a few items that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Missing Checklist**: Please add the standard PR checklist from our template and check off the relevant items. Since this is a significant code change introducing new functionality, we need to ensure you've tested the implementation thoroughly.\n\n2. **Merge Conflicts**: The PR has the 'conflicts' label, indicating there are merge conflicts that need to be resolved before merging.\n\n3. **PR Title Scope**: Consider updating the PR title to use 'platform/blocks' as the scope instead of just 'block' to better align with our conventional commit format and labeled scopes.\n\n4. **Test Plan**: Please provide a test plan detailing how you've verified this integration works correctly. For example:\n   - Connecting to different social media platforms via Ayrshare\n   - Posting content to each supported platform\n   - Handling error cases (e.g., when profile key is missing)\n\nThe implementation itself looks solid, with proper security considerations and a clean architecture.

Please update your PR description to include the standard checklist and complete it.\n\n2. **PR Title/Scope Mismatch**: Your PR title indicates this is a frontend change (`feat(frontend)`), but the vast majority of changes are actually backend-related. The PR adds several new backend files (db.py, model.py, routes.py) and modifies existing backend code.\n\n   Please update your PR title to accurately reflect the scope of changes, such as `feat(platform): Redesign block menu with backend support` or similar that reflects both the frontend and backend work.\n\n3. **PR Description**: Consider expanding your PR description to explain why this redesign was needed and how it improves the current implementation. \n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- Your backend code changes look good from a security perspective - the functions properly use user_id for access control.\n- I noticed you've added a TODO comment \"BLOCK MENU TODO:\" for future work. Make sure these are tracked separately if they won't be addressed in this PR.\n- You've added some new dependencies in package.json (tailwind-scrollbar, react-timeago, etc.) - it would be helpful to mention these in the PR description.\n\nPlease update your PR with these changes so we can proceed with the review process. Let me know if you need any clarification!",
      "Thanks for your work on redesigning the block menu! I noticed a few issues that need to be addressed before this PR can be merged:\n\n## Description and Scope\n\n- Your PR title indicates only frontend changes, but there are significant backend changes (new API routes, models, etc.). The scope in the title should reflect all areas being modified, such as `feat(platform)` or both frontend and backend.\n- The PR description focuses on frontend components but doesn't mention the backend API work. Please update your description to include details about all changes made.\n\n## Missing Required Checklist\n\n- The PR is missing the required checklist that should be filled out completely. Since this includes substantial code changes, please add the checklist and check off all applicable items.\n- Please include a test plan detailing how you've verified the changes work correctly.\n\n## Suggested Changes\n\n1. Update the PR title to correctly represent the scope of changes (e.g., `feat(platform): Redesign block menu on builder page`)\n2. Expand the PR description to include details about the backend API changes\n3. Add the required checklist template and fill it out completely\n4. Include a test plan that describes how you've tested these changes\n\nOnce these issues are addressed, we can proceed with reviewing the code changes in detail.",
      "Thank you for your PR to redesign the block menu! I've reviewed your changes and have a few concerns that need to be addressed before this can be merged:\n\n## Missing Checklist\nThe PR description is missing the required checklist for code changes. Please update your description to include the standard checklist that confirms you've tested your changes properly.\n\n## Scope Mismatch\nYour PR title indicates this is a frontend change (`feat(frontend): Redesign block menu on builder page`), but the changes include significant backend additions:\n- New builder API endpoints\n- New database functions\n- New models and data structures\n\nThese backend changes appear to be more than 20% of the total changes, which exceeds our scope guidelines. You have two options:\n\n1. Split this into two PRs: one for frontend and one for backend changes\n2. Update the PR title to reflect both areas (e.g., `feat(frontend,backend): Redesign block menu with supporting API endpoints`)\n\nThe new backend code looks good in terms of security and user_id handling, but we need to ensure the PR accurately represents the work being done.\n\nPlease update your PR accordingly, and let me know if you need any help or clarification!",
      "Thanks for the PR to redesign the block menu! The components structure you've listed looks well organized.\n\nI noticed a couple of issues that need to be addressed before this can be merged:\n\n1. **Missing checklist**: The PR template requires a checklist section to be completed for code changes. Please add the checklist from the template and fill it out appropriately, especially including your test plan.\n\n2. **Scope mismatch**: Your PR title indicates this is purely a frontend change (`feat(frontend)`), but the PR contains substantial backend changes including:\n   - New backend API routes in `/api/builder`\n   - New backend models and database methods\n   - Changes to existing backend services\n\nPlease update either:\n   - The PR title to reflect both frontend and backend changes (e.g., `feat(platform): Redesign block menu and add builder API endpoints`)\n   - OR split this into separate PRs for frontend and backend changes\n\nAlso, I notice you've marked some tasks with \"BLOCK MENU TODO\" for future work. It would be helpful to clarify in the PR description which parts are complete in this PR and which parts are planned for future PRs.\n\nLet me know if you need any help with these changes!",
      "Thank you for your work on redesigning the block menu for the builder page.
