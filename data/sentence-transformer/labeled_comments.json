    "comment body": "Hacktoberfest is strenuous for our team of active volunteer maintainers. That small team now has ___200+ open pull requests___ to review.  We have __high standards for our submissions__ which are described in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-guidelines).  Our continuous integration tests help to ensure that our standards are met before we review and merge deserving pull requests.  This is further complicated by the fact that we already have [lots of algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/DIRECTORY.md) and would like to avoid duplicates.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I will **close all open pull requests failing tests** so that our unpaid team has a smaller mountain to climb.  If you want us to land your pull request, please make sure it is not a duplicate and then read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-guidelines) _carefully_ and try again.",
